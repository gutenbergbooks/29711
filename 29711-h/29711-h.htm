THE ROAD</h2>

<p>The road stretched in a pale, straight streak,
narrowing to a mere thread at the limit of vision&mdash;the
only living thing in the wild darkness. All
was very still. It had been raining; the wet
heather and the pines gave forth scent, and little
gusty shivers shook the dripping birch trees. In
the pools of sky, between broken clouds, a few
stars shone, and half of a thin moon was seen
from time to time, like the fragment of a silver
horn held up there in an invisible hand, waiting
to be blown.</p>

<p>Hard to say when I first became aware that
there was movement on the road, little specks of
darkness on it far away, till its end was blackened
out of sight, and it seemed to shorten towards
me. Whatever was coming darkened it as an
invading army of ants will darken a streak of sunlight
on sand strewn with pine needles. Slowly
this shadow crept along till it had covered all but
the last dip and rise; and still it crept forward in
that eerie way, as yet too far off for sound.</p>

<p>Then began the voice of it in the dripping stillness,
a tramping of weary feet, and I could tell
that this advancing shadow was formed of men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
millions of them moving all at one speed, very
slowly, as if regulated by the march of the most
tired among them. They had blotted out the
road, now, from a few yards away to the horizon;
and suddenly, in the dusk, a face showed.</p>

<p>Its eyes were eager, its lips parted, as if each
step was the first the marcher had ever taken;
and yet he was stumbling, almost asleep from
tiredness. A young man he was, with skin drawn
tight over his heavy cheek-bones and jaw, under
the platter of his helmet, and burdened with all
his soldier's load. At first I saw his face alone
in the darkness, startlingly clear; and then a very
sea of helmeted faces, with their sunken eyes
shining, and their lips parted. Watching them
pass&mdash;heavy and dim and spectre-like in the
darkness, those eager dead-beat men&mdash;I knew as
never before how they had longed for this last
march, and in fancy seen the road, and dreamed
of the day when they would be trudging home.
Their hearts seemed laid bare to me, the sickening
hours they had waited, dreaming and longing,
in boots rusty with blood. And the night was
full of the loneliness and waste they had been
through....</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Morning! At the edge of the town the road
came arrow-straight to the first houses and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
gardens, past them, and away to the streets. In
every window and at each gate children, women,
men, were looking down the road. Face after
face was painted, various, by the sunlight, homely
with line and wrinkle, curve and dimple, pallid
or ruddy, but the look in the eyes of all these
faces seemed the same. "I have waited so long,"
it said, "I cannot wait any more&mdash;I cannot!"
Their hands were clasped, and by the writhing of
those hands I knew how they had yearned, and
the madness of delight waiting to leap from them&mdash;wives,
mothers, fathers, children, the patient
hopers against hope.</p>

<p>Far out on the road something darkened the
sunlight. <i>They were coming!</i></p>

<h2>THE SACRED WORK</h2>

<p>The Angel of Peace, watching the slow folding
back of this darkness, will look on an earth of
cripples. The field of the world is strewn with
half-living men. That loveliness which is the
creation of the æsthetic human spirit; that flowering
of directed energy which we know as civilisation;
that manifold and mutual service which we
call progress&mdash;all stand mutilated and faltering.
As though, on a pilgrimage to the dreamed-of
Mecca, water had failed, and by the wayside
countless muffled forms sat waiting for rain; so
will the long road of mankind look to-morrow.</p>

<p>In every township and village of our countries
men stricken by the war will dwell for the next
half-century. The figure of Youth must go one-footed,
one-armed, blind of an eye, lesioned and
stunned, in the home where it once danced. The
half of a generation can never again step into
the sunlight of full health and the priceless
freedom of unharmed limbs.</p>

<p><i>So comes the sacred work.</i></p>

<p>Can there be limit to the effort of gratitude?
Niggardliness and delay in restoring all of life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
that can be given back is sin against the human
spirit, a smear on the face of honour.</p>

<p>Love of country, which, like some little secret
lamp, glows in every heart, hardly to be seen of
our eyes when the world is at peace&mdash;love of the
old, close things, the sights, sounds, scents we
have known from birth; loyalty to our fathers'
deeds and our fathers' hopes; the clutch of Motherland&mdash;this
love sent our soldiers and sailors
forth to the long endurance, to the doing of such
deeds, and the bearing of so great and evil pain
as can never be told. The countries for which
they have dared and suffered have now to play
their part.</p>

<p>The conscience of to-day is burdened with a
load well-nigh unbearable. Each hour of the
sacred work unloads a little of this burden.</p>

<p>To lift up the man who has been stricken on
the battlefield, restore him to the utmost of
health and agility, give him an adequate pension,
and re-equip him with an occupation suited to
the forces left him&mdash;that is a process which does
not cease till the sufferer fronts the future keen,
hopeful, and secure. And such restoration is at
least as much a matter of spirit as of body. Consider
what it means to fall suddenly out of full
vigour into the dark certainty that you can never
have full strength again, though you live on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
twenty, forty, sixty years. The flag of your
courage may well be down half-mast! Apathy&mdash;that
creeping nerve disease&mdash;is soon your bed-fellow
and the companion of your walks. A curtain
has fallen before your vision; your eyes
no longer range. The Russian "Nichevo"&mdash;the
"what-does-it-matter?" mood&mdash;besets you. Fate
seems to say to you: "Take the line of least resistance,
friend&mdash;you are done for!" But the
sacred work says to Fate: "<i>Retro, Satanas!</i> This
our comrade is not your puppet. He shall yet
live as happy and as useful&mdash;if not as active&mdash;a
life as he ever lived before. You shall not crush
him! We shall tend him from clearing station
till his discharge better than wounded soldier has
ever yet been tended. In special hospitals, orthopædic,
paraplegic, phthisic, neurasthenic, we shall
give him back functional ability, solidity of nerve
or lung. The flesh torn away, the lost sight, the
broken ear-drum, the destroyed nerve, it is true,
we cannot give back; but we shall so re-create
and fortify the rest of him that he shall leave
hospital ready for a new career. Then we shall
teach him how to tread the road of it, so that he
fits again into the national life, becomes once
more a workman with pride in his work, a stake
in the country, and the consciousness that, handicapped
though he be, he runs the race level with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
his fellows, and is by that so much the better man
than they. And beneath the feet of this new
workman we shall put the firm plank of a pension."</p>

<p>The sacred work fights the creeping dejections
which lie in wait for each soul and body, for the
moment stricken and thrown. It says to Fate:
"You shall not pass!"</p>

<p>And the greatest obstacle with which it meets
is the very stoicism and nonchalance of the sufferer!
To the Anglo-Saxon, especially, those precious
qualities are dangerous. That horse, taken
to the water, will too seldom drink. Indifference
to the future has a certain loveability, but is
hardly a virtue when it makes of its owner a
weary drone, eking out a pension with odd jobs.
The sacred work is vitally concerned to defeat
this hand-to-mouth philosophy. Side by side in
man, and especially in Anglo-Saxon, there live
two creatures. One of them lies on his back and
smokes; the other runs a race; now one, now the
other, seems to be the whole man. The sacred
work has for its end to keep the runner on his
feet; to proclaim the nobility of running. A man
will do for mankind or for his country what he
will not do for himself; but mankind marches on,
and countries live and grow, and need our services
in peace no less than in war. Drums do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
not beat, the flags hang furled, in time of peace;
but a quiet music is ever raising its call to service.
He who in war has flung himself, without thought
of self, on the bayonet and braved a hail of bullets
often does not hear that quiet music. It is the
business of the sacred work to quicken his ear to
it. Of little use to man or nation would be the
mere patching-up of bodies, so that, like a row of
old gossips against a sunlit wall, our disabled
might sit and weary out their days. If that were
all we could do for them, gratitude is proven
fraudulent, device bankrupt; and the future of
our countries must drag with a lame foot.</p>

<p>To one who has watched, rather from outside,
it seems that restoration worthy of that word will
only come if the minds of all engaged in the sacred
work are always fixed on this central truth: "Body
and spirit are inextricably conjoined; to heal the
one without the other is impossible." If a man's
mind, courage and interest be enlisted in the
cause of his own salvation, healing goes on apace,
the sufferer is remade. If not, no mere surgical
wonders, no careful nursing, will avail to make a
man of him again. Therefore I would say:
"From the moment he enters hospital, look after
his mind and his will; give them food; nourish
them in subtle ways, increase that nourishment
as his strength increases. Give him interest in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
his future; light a star for him to fix his eyes on.
So that, when he steps out of hospital, you shall
not have to begin to train one who for months,
perhaps years, has been living, mindless and will-less,
the life of a half-dead creature."</p>

<p>That this is a hard task none who knows hospital
life can doubt.</p>

<p>That it needs special qualities and special effort
quite other than the average range of hospital devotion
is obvious. But it saves time in the end,
and without it success is more than doubtful.
The crucial period is the time spent in hospital;
use that period to re-create not only body, but
mind and will-power, and all shall come out right;
neglect to use it thus, and the heart of many a
sufferer, and of many a would-be healer, will
break from sheer discouragement.</p>

<p>The sacred work is not departmental; it is one
long organic process from the moment when a
man is picked up from the field of battle to the
moment when he is restored to the ranks of full
civil life. Our eyes must not be fixed merely on
this stressful present, but on the world as it will
be ten years hence. I see that world gazing back,
like a repentant drunkard at his own debauch,
with a sort of horrified amazement and disgust.
I see it impatient of any reminiscence of this hurricane;
hastening desperately to recover what it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
enjoyed before life was wrecked and pillaged by
these blasts of death. Hearts, which now swell
with pity and gratitude when our maimed soldiers
pass the streets, will, from sheer familiarity, and
through natural shrinking from reminder, be dried
to a stony indifference. "Let the dead past bury
its dead" is a saying terribly true, and perhaps
essential to the preservation of mankind. The
world of ten years hence will shrug its shoulders
if it sees maimed and <i>useless</i> men crawling the
streets of its day, like winter flies on a windowpane.</p>

<p>It is for the sacred work to see that there shall
be no winter flies. A niche of usefulness and self-respect
exists for every man, however handicapped;
but that niche must be found for him.
To carry the process of restoration to a point
short of this is to leave the cathedral without
spire.</p>

<p>Of the men and women who have this work in
hand I have seen enough&mdash;in France and in my
own country, at least&mdash;to know their worth, and
the selfless idealism which animates them. Their
devotion, courage, tenacity, and technical ability
are beyond question or praise. I would only fear
that in the hard struggle they experience to carry
each day's work to its end, to perfect their own
particular jobs, all so important and so difficult,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
vision of the whole fabric they are helping to raise
must often be obscured. And I would venture to
say: "Only by looking upon each separate disabled
soldier as the complete fabric can you possibly
keep that vision before your eyes. Only by
revivifying in each separate disabled soldier the
<i>will to live</i> can you save him from the fate of
merely continuing to exist."</p>

<p>There are wounded men, many, whose spirit is
such that they will march in front of any effort
made for their recovery. I well remember one of
these&mdash;a Frenchman&mdash;nearly paralysed in both
legs. All day long he would work at his "macramé,"
and each morning, after treatment, would
demand to try and stand. I can see his straining
efforts now, his eyes like the eyes of a spirit; I can
hear his daily words: "<i>Il me semble que j'ai un
peu plus de force dans mes jambes ce matin, Monsieur!</i>"
though, I fear, he never had. Men of
such indomitable initiative, though not rare, are
but a fraction. The great majority have rather
the happy-go-lucky soul. For them it is only
too easy to postpone self-help till sheer necessity
drives, or till some one in whom they believe inspires
them. The work of re-equipping these
with initiative, with a new interest in life, with
work which they can do, is one of infinite difficulty
and complexity. Nevertheless, it must be done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
The great publics of our countries do not yet, I
think, see that they too have their part in the
sacred work. So far they only seem to feel:
"Here's a wounded hero; let's take him to the
movies, and give him tea!" Instead of choking
him with cheap kindness each member of the
public should seek to reinspire the disabled man
with the feeling that he is no more out of the
main stream of life than they are themselves; and
each, according to his or her private chances,
should help him to find that special niche which
he can best, most cheerfully, and most usefully
fill in the long future.</p>

<p>The more we drown the disabled in tea and lip
gratitude the more we unsteel his soul, and the
harder we make it for him to win through, when,
in the years to come, the wells of our tea and
gratitude have dried up. We can do a much
more real and helpful thing. I fear that there
will soon be no one of us who has not some personal
friend disabled. Let us regard that man
as if he were ourselves; let us treat him as one
who demands a full place in the ranks of working
life, and try to find it for him.</p>

<p>In such ways alone will come a new freemasonry
to rebuild this ruined temple of our day. The
ground is rubbled with stones&mdash;fallen, and still
falling. Each must be replaced; freshly shaped,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
cemented, and mortised in, that the whole may
once more stand firm and fair. In good time, to a
clearer sky than we are fortunate enough to look
on, our temple shall rise again. The birds shall
not long build in its broken walls, nor lichens
moss it. The winds shall not long play through
these now jagged windows, nor the rain drift in,
nor moonlight fill it with ghosts and shadows.
To the glory of man we will stanchion, and raise
and roof it anew.</p>

<p>Each comrade who for his Motherland has, for
the moment, lost his future is a miniature of that
shattered temple.</p>

<p>To restore him, and with him the future of our
countries, that is the sacred work.</p>

<h2>THE BALANCE SHEET OF THE<br />
SOLDIER-WORKMAN</h2>

<p>Let the reader take what follows with more
than a grain of salt. No one can foretell&mdash;surely
not this writer&mdash;with anything approaching certainty
what will be the final effect of this war on
the soldier-workman. One can but marshal some
of the more obvious and general liabilities and
assets, and try to strike a balance. The whole
thing is in flux. Millions are going into the crucible
at every temperature; and who shall say at
all precisely what will come out or what conditions
the product issuing will meet with, though
they obviously cannot be the same as before the
war? For in considering this question, one must
run into the account on either side not only the
various effects of the war on the soldier-workman,
but the altered influences his life will encounter
in the future, so far as one can foresee; and this
is all navigation in uncharted waters.</p>

<p>Talking with and observing French soldiers during
the winter of 1916&ndash;1917, and often putting
to them this very question: How is the war going
to affect the soldier-workman? I noticed that
their answers followed very much the trend of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
class and politics. An adjutant, sergeant, or devout
Catholic considered that men would be improved,
gain self-command, and respect for law
and order, under prolonged discipline and daily
sacrifice. A freethinker of the educated class, or
a private of Socialistic tendencies, on the other
hand, would insist that the strain must make men
restless, irritable, more eager for their rights, less
tolerant of control. Each imagined that the war
would further the chances of the future as they
dreamed of it. If I had talked with capitalists&mdash;there
are none among French soldiers&mdash;they
would doubtless have insisted that after-war conditions
were going to be easier, just as the "<i>sans-sous</i>"
maintained that they were going to be
harder and provocative of revolution. In a word,
the wish was father to the thought.</p>

<p>Having observed this so strongly, the writer of
these speculations says to himself: "Let me, at
all events, try to eliminate any bias, and see the
whole thing as should an umpire&mdash;one of those
pure beings in white coats, purged of all the prejudices,
passions, and predilections of mankind.
Let me have no temperament for the time being,
for I have to set down&mdash;not what would be the
effect on me if I were in their place, or what
would happen to the future if I could have my
way, but what would happen all the same if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
were not alive. Only from an impersonal point
of view, if there be such a thing, am I going to
get even approximately at the truth."</p>

<p>Impersonally, then, one notes the credit facts
and probabilities towards the future's greater
well-being; and those on the debit side, of retrogression
from the state of well-being, such as it
was, which prevailed when war was declared.</p>

<p>First, what will be the physical effect of the
war on the soldier-workman? Military training,
open-air life, and plentiful food are of such obvious
physical advantage in the vast majority of cases
as to need no pointing out. And how much improvement
was wanted is patent to any one who
has a remnant left of the old Greek worship of
the body. It has made one almost despair of
industrialised England to see the great Australians
pass in the streets of London. We English cannot
afford to neglect the body any longer; we are
becoming, I am much afraid, a warped, stunted,
intensely plain people. On that point I refuse to
speak with diffidence, for it is my business to
know something about beauty, and in our masters
and pastors I see no sign of knowledge and little
inkling of concern, since there is no public opinion
to drive them forward to respect beauty. One-half
of us regard good looks as dangerous and savouring
of immorality; the other half look upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
them as "swank," or at least superfluous. Any
interest manifested in such a subject is confined
to a few women and a handful of artists. Let
any one who has an eye for looks take the trouble
to observe the people who pass in the streets of
any of our big towns, he will count perhaps one
in five&mdash;not beautiful&mdash;but with some pretensions
to being not absolutely plain; and one can say
this without fear of hurting any feelings, for all
will think themselves exceptions. Frivolity apart,
there is a dismal lack of good looks and good physique
in our population; and it will be all to the
good to have had this physical training. If that
training had stopped short of the fighting line it
would be physically entirely beneficial; as it is,
one has unfortunately to set against its advantages&mdash;leaving
out wounds and mutilation altogether&mdash;a
considerable number of overstrained
hearts and nerves, not amounting to actual disablement;
and a great deal of developed rheumatism.</p>

<p>Peace will send back to their work very many
men better set up and hardier; but many also obviously
or secretly weakened. Hardly any can
go back as they were. Yet, while training will
but have brought out strength which was always
latent, and which, unless relapse be guarded
against, must rapidly decline, cases of strain and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
rheumatism will for the most part be permanent,
and such as would not have taken place under
peace conditions. Then there is the matter of
venereal disease, which the conditions of military
life are carefully fostering&mdash;no negligible factor
on the debit side; the health of many hundreds
must be written off on that score. To credit,
again, must be placed increased personal cleanliness,
much greater handiness and resource in the
small ways of life, and an even more complete
endurance and contempt of illness than already
characterised the British workman, if that be
possible. On the whole I think that, physically,
the scales will balance pretty evenly.</p>

<p>Next, what will be the effect of the war on the
mental powers of the soldier-workman? Unlike
the French (sixty per cent. of whose army are
men working on the land), our army must contain
at least ninety per cent. of town workers,
whose minds in time of peace are kept rather
more active than those of workers on the land by
the ceaseless friction and small decisions of town
life. To gauge the result of two to five years'
military life on the minds of these town workers
is a complicated and stubborn problem. Here we
have the exact converse of the physical case. If
the army life of the soldier-workman stopped
short of service at the front one might say at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
once that the effect on his mind would be far
more disastrous than it is. The opportunity for
initiative and decision, the mental stir of camp
and depôt life is <i>nil</i> compared with that of service
in the fighting line. And for one month at
the front a man spends perhaps five at the rear.
Military life, on its negative side, is more or less
a suspension of the usual channels of mental
activity. By barrack and camp life the normal
civilian intellect is, as it were, marooned. On
that desert island it finds, no doubt, certain new
and very definite forms of activity, but any one
who has watched old soldiers must have been
struck by the "arrested" look which is stamped
on most of them&mdash;by a kind of remoteness, of
concentrated emptiness, as of men who by the
conditions of their lives have long been prevented
from thinking of anything outside a ring fence.
Two to five years' service will not be long enough
to set the old soldier's stamp on a mind, but one
can see the process beginning; and it will be quite
long enough to encourage laziness in minds already
disposed to lying fallow. Far be it from this pen
to libel the English, but a feverish mental activity
has never been their vice; intellect, especially in
what is known as the working-class, is leisurely;
it does not require to be encouraged to take its
ease. Some one has asked me: "<i>Can</i> the ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
worker think less in the army than when he wasn't
in the army?" In other words: "Did he ever
think at all?" The British worker is, of course,
deceptive; he does not look as if he were thinking.
Whence exactly does he get his stolidity&mdash;from
climate, self-consciousness, or his competitive
spirit? All the same, thought does go on in him,
shrewd and "near-the-bone"; life-made rather
than book-made thought. Its range is limited by
its vocabulary; it starts from different premises,
reaches different conclusions from those of the
"pundit," and so is liable to seem to the latter
non-existent. But let a worker and an educated
man sit opposite each other in a railway carriage
without exchanging a word, as is the fashion with
the English, and which of their two silent judgments
on the other will be superior? I am not
sure, but I rather think the worker's. It will
have a kind of deadly realism. In camp and
depôt life the mind standing-at-ease from many
civilian frictions and needs for decision, however
petty, and shaken away from civilian ruts, will do
a good deal of thinking of a sort, be widened, and
probably re-value many things&mdash;especially when
its owner goes abroad and sees fresh types, fresh
manners, and the world. But actual physical exertion,
and the inertia which follows it, bulk large
in military service, and many who "never thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
at all" before they became soldiers will think
still less after! I may be cynical, but it seems to
me that the chief stimulus to thought in the ordinary
mind is money, the getting and the spending
thereof; that what we call "politics," those social
interests which form at least half the staple of the
ordinary worker's thought, are made up of concern
as to the wherewithal to live. In the army
money is a fixed quantity which demands no
thought, neither in the getting nor the spending;
and the constant mental activity which in normal
life circles round money of necessity dries up.</p>

<p>But against this indefinite general rusting of
mind machinery in the soldier-workman's life
away from the fighting line certain definite considerations
must be set. Many soldiers will form
a habit of reading&mdash;in the new armies the demand
for books is great; some in sheer boredom will
have begun an all-round cultivation of their
minds; others again will be chafing continually
against this prolonged holding-up of their habitual
mental traffic&mdash;and when a man chafes he does
not exactly rust; so that, while the naturally lazy
will have been made more lazy, the naturally
eager may be made very eager.</p>

<p>The matter of age, too, is not unimportant. A
soldier of twenty, twenty-five, even up to thirty,
probably seldom feels that the mode of life from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
which he has been taken is set and permanent.
He may be destined to do that work all his days,
but the knowledge of this has not so far bitten
him; he is not yet in the swing and current of his
career, and feels no great sense of dislocation.
But a man of thirty-five or forty, taken from an
occupation which has got grip on him, feels that
his life has had a slice carved out of it. He may
realise the necessity better than the younger man,
take his duty more seriously, but must have a
sensation as if his springs were let down flat.
The knowledge that he has to resume his occupation
again in real middle age, with all the steam
escaped, must be profoundly discouraging; therefore
I think his mental activity will suffer more
than that of the younger man. The recuperative
powers of youth are so great that very many of
our younger soldiers will unrust quickly and at a
bound regain all the activity lost. Besides, a
very great many of the younger men will not go
back to the old job. But older men, though they
will go back to what they were doing before more
readily than their juniors, will go back with diminished
hope and energy, and a sort of fatalism.
At forty, even at thirty-five, every year begins to
seem important, and several years will have been
wrenched out of their working lives just, perhaps,
when they were beginning to make good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Turning to the spells of service at the front&mdash;there
will be no rusting there&mdash;the novelty of
sensation, the demand for initiative and adaptability
are too great. A soldier said to me: "My
two years in depôt and camp were absolutely
deadening; that eight weeks at the front before I
was knocked over were the best eight weeks I
ever had." Spells at the front must wipe out all
or nearly all the rust; but against them must be
set the deadening spells of hospital, which too
often follow, the deadening spells of training
which have gone before; and the more considerable
though not very permanent factor&mdash;that
laziness and dislocation left on the minds of many
who have been much in the firing line. As the
same young soldier put it: "I can't concentrate
now as I could on a bit of work&mdash;it takes me
longer; all the same, where I used to chuck it
when I found it hard, I set my teeth now." In
other words, less mental but more moral grip.</p>

<p>On the whole, then, so far as mental effect goes,
I believe the balance must come out on the debit
side.</p>

<p>And, now, what will be the spiritual effect of
the war on the soldier-workman? And by "spiritual"
I mean the effect of his new life and emotional
experience, neither on his intellect, nor
exactly on his "soul"&mdash;for very few men have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
anything so rarefied&mdash;but on his disposition and
character.</p>

<p>Has any one the right to discuss this who has
not fought? It is with the greatest diffidence
that I hazard any view. On the other hand, the
effects are so various, and so intensely individual,
that perhaps only such a one has a chance of
forming a general judgment unbiassed by personal
experience and his own temperament. What
thousands of strange and poignant feelings must
pass through even the least impressionable soldier
who runs the gamut of this war's "experience"!
And there will not be too many of our soldier-workmen
returning to civil life without having
had at least a taste of everything. The embryo
Guardsman who sticks his bayonet into a sack,
be he never so unimaginative, with each jab of
that bayonet pictures dimly the body of a "Hun,"
and gets used to the sensation of spitting it. On
every long march there comes a time that may
last hours when the recruit feels done up, and yet
has to go on "sticking it." Never a day passes,
all through his service, without some moment
when he would give his soul to be out of it all
and back in some little elysium of the past; but
he has to grit his teeth and try to forget. Hardly
a man who, when he first comes under fire, has
not a struggle with himself which amounts to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
spiritual victory. Not many who do not arrive
at a "Don't care" state of mind that is almost
equal to a spiritual defeat. No soldier who does
not rub shoulders during his service with countless
comrades strange to him, and get a wider
understanding and a fuller tolerance. Not a soul
in the trenches, one would think, who is not
caught up into a mood of comradeship and self-suppression
which amounts almost to exaltation.
Not one but has to fight through moods almost
reaching extinction of the very love of life. And
shall all this&mdash;and the many hard disappointments,
and the long yearning for home and those
he loves, and the chafing against continual restraints,
and the welling-up of secret satisfaction
in the "bit done," the knowledge that Fate is
not beating, cannot beat him; and the sight of
death all round, and the looking into Death's eyes&mdash;staring
those eyes down; and the long bearing
of pain; and the pity for his comrades bearing
pain&mdash;shall all this pass his nature by without
marking it for life? When all is over, and the
soldier-workman back in civil life, will his character
be enlarged or shrunken? The nature of a
man is never really changed, no more than a
leopard's skin, it is but developed or dwarfed.
The influences of the war will have as many little
forms as there are soldiers, and to attempt precision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
of summary is clearly vain. It is something
of a truism to suggest that the war will ennoble
and make more serious those who before the war
took a noble and serious view of life; and that on
those who took life callously it will have a callousing
effect. The problem is rather to discover
what effect, if any, will be made on that medium
material which was neither definitely serious nor
obviously callous. And for this we must go to
consideration of main national characteristics. It
is&mdash;for one thing&mdash;very much the nature of the
Briton to look on life as a game with victory or
defeat at the end of it, and to feel it impossible
that he can be defeated. He is not so much concerned
to "live" as to win this life match. He
is combative from one minute to the next, reacts
instantly against any attempt to down him. The
war for him is a round in this great personal match
of his with Fate, and he is completely caught up
in the idea of winning it. He is spared that
double consciousness of the French soldier who
wants to "live," who goes on indeed superbly
fighting "<i>pour la France</i>" out of love for his
country, but all the time cannot help saying to
himself: "What a fool I am&mdash;what sort of life is
this?" I have heard it said by one who ought
to know, if any one can, that the British soldier
hardly seems to have a sense of patriotism, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
goes through it all as a sort of private "scrap" in
which he does not mean to be beaten, and out of
loyalty to his regiment, his "team," so to speak.
This is partly true, but the Briton is very deep,
and there are feelings at the bottom of his well
which never see the light. If the British soldier
were fighting on a line which ran from Lowestoft
through York to Sunderland, he might show very
different symptoms. Still, at bottom he would
always, I think, feel the business to be first in the
nature of a contest with a force which was trying
to down him personally. In this contest he is
being stretched, and steeled&mdash;that is, hardened
and confirmed&mdash;in the very quality of stubborn
combativeness which was already his first characteristic.</p>

<p>Take another main feature of the national
character&mdash;the Briton is ironic. Well, the war
is deepening his irony. It must, for it is a monstrously
ironic business.</p>

<p>Some&mdash;especially those who wish to&mdash;believe in
a religious revival among the soldiers. There's
an authentic story of two convalescent soldiers
describing a battle. The first finished thus: "I
tell you it makes you think of God." The second&mdash;a
thoughtful type&mdash;ended with a pause, and
then these words: "Who could believe in God
after that?" Like all else in human life, it depends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
on temperament. The war will speed up
"belief" in some and "disbelief" in others. But,
on the whole, comic courage shakes no hands with
orthodoxy.</p>

<p>The religious movement which I think <i>is</i> going
on is of a subtler and a deeper sort altogether.
Men are discovering that human beings are finer
than they had supposed. A young man said to
me: "Well, I don't know about religion, but I
know that my opinion of human nature is about
fifty per cent. better than it was." That conclusion
has been arrived at by countless thousands.
It is a great factor&mdash;seeing that the belief of the
future will be belief in the God within; and a
frank agnosticism concerning the great "Why"
of things. Religion will become the exaltation of
self-respect, of what we call the divine in man.
"The Kingdom of God" is within you. That
belief, old as the hills, and reincarnated by Tolstoi
years ago, has come into its own in the war;
for it has been clearly proved to be the real faith
of modern man, underneath all verbal attempts
to assert the contrary. This&mdash;the white side of
war&mdash;is an extraordinarily heartening phenomenon;
and if it sent every formal creed in the
world packing there would still be a gain to
religion.</p>

<p>Another main characteristic of the Briton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
especially of the "working" Briton, is improvidence&mdash;he
likes, unconsciously, to live from
hand to mouth, careless of the morrow. The war
is deepening that characteristic too&mdash;it must, for
who could endure if he fretted over what was
going to happen to him, with death so in the
wind?</p>

<p>Thus the average soldier-workman will return
from the war confirmed and deepened in at least
three main national characteristics: His combative
hardihood, his ironic humour, and his improvidence.
I think he will have more of what is
called "character"; whether for good or evil depends,
I take it, on what we connote by those
terms, and in what context we use them. I may
look on "character" as an asset, but I can well
imagine politicians and trades union leaders regarding
it with profound suspicion. Anyway, he
will not be the lamb that he was not even before
the war. He will be a restive fellow, knowing
his own mind better, and possibly his real interest
less well; he will play less for safety, since
safety will have become to him a civilian sort of
thing, rather contemptible. He will have at once
a more interesting and a less reliable character
from the social and political point of view.</p>

<p>And what about his humanity? Can he go
through all this hell of slaughter and violence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
untouched in his gentler instincts? There will be&mdash;there
must be&mdash;some brutalisation. But old
soldiers are not usually inhumane&mdash;on the contrary,
they are often very gentle beings. I distrust
the influence of the war on those who merely
write and read about it. I think editors, journalists,
old gentlemen, and women will be brutalised
in larger numbers than our soldiers. An intelligent
French soldier said to me of his own countrymen:
"After six months of civil life, you won't
know they ever had to 'clean up' trenches and
that sort of thing." If this is true of the Frenchman,
it will be more true of the less impressionable
Briton. If I must sum up at all on what, for
want of a better word, I have called the "spiritual"
count, I can only say that there will be a
distinct increase of "character," and leave it to
the reader to decide whether that falls on the
debit or the credit side.</p>

<p>On the whole then, an increase of "character,"
a slight loss of mental activity, and neither physical
gain nor loss to speak of.</p>

<p>We have now to consider the rather deadly
matter of demobilisation. One hears the suggestion
that not more than 30,000 men shall be disbanded
per week; this means two years at least.
Conceive millions of men whose sense of sacrifice
has been stretched to the full for a definite object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
which has been gained&mdash;conceive them held in a
weary, and, as it seems to them, unnecessary
state of suspense. Kept back from all they long
for, years after the reality of their service has
departed! If this does not undermine them, I
do not know what will. Demobilisation&mdash;they
say&mdash;must be cautious. "No man should be released
till a place in the industrial machine is
ready waiting for him!" So, in a counsel of perfection,
speak the wise who have not been deprived
of home life, civil liberty, and what not
for a dismal length of two, three, and perhaps
four years. No! Demobilisation should be as
swift as possible, and risks be run to make it swift.
The soldier-workman who goes back to civil life
within two or three months after peace is signed
goes back with a glow still in his heart. But he
who returns with a rankling sense of unmerited,
unintelligible delay&mdash;most prudently, of course,
ordained&mdash;goes back with "cold feet" and a
sullen or revolting spirit. What men will stand
under the shadow of a great danger from a sense
of imminent duty, they will furiously chafe at
when that danger and sense of duty are no more.
The duty will then be to their families and to
themselves. There is no getting away from this,
and the country will be well advised not to be too
coldly cautious. Every one, of course, must wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
to ease to the utmost the unprecedented economic
and industrial confusion which the signing of
peace will bring, but it will be better to risk a
good deal of momentary unemployment and discontent
rather than neglect the human factor and
keep men back long months in a service of which
they will be deadly sick. How sick they will be
may perhaps be guessed at from the words of a
certain soldier: "After the war you'll <i>have</i> to have
conscription. You won't get a man to go into the
army without!" What is there to prevent the
Government from beginning now to take stock
of the demands of industry, from having a great
land settlement scheme cut and dried, and devising
means for the swiftest possible demobilisation?
The moment peace is signed the process
of re-absorption into civil life should begin at
once and go on without interruption as swiftly as
the actual difficulties of transport permit. They,
of themselves, will hold up demobilisation quite
long enough. The soldier-workman will recognise
and bear with the necessary physical delays,
but he will not tolerate for a moment any others
for his so-called benefit.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>And what sort of civil life will it be which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
awaits the soldier-workman? I suppose, if anything
is certain, a plenitude, nay a plethora, of
work is assured for some time after the war.
Capital has piled up in hands which will control
a vast amount of improved and convertible machinery.
Purchasing power has piled up in the
shape of savings out of the increased national
income. Granted that income will at once begin
to drop all round, shrinking perhaps fast to below
the pre-war figures, still at first there must be a
rolling river of demand and the wherewithal to
satisfy it. For years no one has built houses, or
had their houses done up; no one has bought furniture,
clothes, or a thousand other articles which
they propose buying the moment the war stops.
Railways and rolling stock, roads, housing, public
works of all sorts, private motor cars, and
pleasure requirements of every kind have been
let down and starved. Huge quantities of shipping
must be replaced; vast renovations of destroyed
country must be undertaken; numberless
repairs to damaged property; the tremendous
process of converting or re-converting machinery
to civil uses must be put through; State schemes
to deal with the land, housing, and other problems
will be in full blast; a fierce industrial competition
will commence; and, above all, we must
positively grow our own food in the future. Besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
all this we shall have lost at least a million
workers through death, disablement, and emigration;
indeed, unless we have some really attractive
land scheme ready we may lose a million by
emigration alone. In a word, the demand for
labour, at the moment, will be overwhelming, and
the vital question only one of readjustment. In
numberless directions women, boys, and older
men have replaced the soldier-workman. Hundreds
of thousands of soldiers, especially among
the first three million, have been guaranteed reinstatement.
Hundreds of thousands of substitutes
will, therefore, be thrown out of work. With the
exception of the skilled men who have had to be
retained in their places all through, and the men
who step back into places kept for them, the
whole working population will have to be refitted
with jobs. The question of women's labour will
not be grave at first because there will be work
for all and more than all, but the jigsaw puzzle
which industry will have to put together will try
the nerves and temper of the whole community.
In the French army the peasant soldier is jealous
and sore because he has had to bear the chief burden
of the fighting, while the mechanic has to a
great extent been kept for munition making,
transport, and essential civil industry. With us
it is if anything the other way. In the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
army, too, the feeling runs high against the "<i>embusqué</i>,"
the man who&mdash;often unjustly&mdash;is supposed
to have avoided service. I do not know
to what extent the same feeling prevails in our
army, but there is certainly an element of it,
which will not make for content or quietude.</p>

<p>Another burning question after the war will be
wages. We are assured they are going to keep
up. Well, we shall see. Certain special rates
will, of course, come down at once. And if, in
general, wages keep up, it will not, I think, be for
very long. Still, times will be good at first for
employers and employed. At first&mdash;and then!</p>

<p>Some thinkers insist that the war has to an
appreciable extent been financed out of savings
which would otherwise have been spent on luxury.
But the amount thus saved can easily be exaggerated&mdash;the
luxurious class is not really large,
and against their saving must be set the spending
by the working classes, out of increased wages,
on what in peace years were not necessities of
their existence. In other words, the luxurious or
investing class has cut off its peace-time fripperies,
saved and lent to the Government; the Government
has paid the bulk of this money to the working
class, who have spent most of it in what to
them would be fripperies in time of peace. It
may be, it <i>is</i>, all to the good that luxurious tastes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
should be clipped from the wealthy, and a higher
standard of living secured to the workers, but this
is rather a matter of distribution and social health
than of economics in relation to the financing of
the war.</p>

<p>There are those who argue that because the
general productive effort of the country during
the war has been speeded up to half as much
again as that of normal times, by tapping women's
labour, by longer hours and general improvement
in machinery and industrial ideas, the war will
not result in any great economic loss, and that we
may with care and effort avoid the coming of bad
times after the first boom. The fact remains,
and anybody can test it for himself, that there is
a growing shortage of practically everything except&mdash;they
say&mdash;cheap jewellery and pianos. I
am no economist, but that does seem to indicate
that this extra production has not greatly compensated
for the enormous application of labour
and material resources to the quick-wasting ends
of war instead of to the slow-wasting ends of
civil life. In other words, a vast amount of productive
energy and material is being shot away.
Now this, I suppose, would not matter, in fact
might be beneficial to trade by increasing demand,
if the purchasing power of the public
remained what it was before the war. But in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
the great countries of the world, even America,
the peoples will be faced with taxation which
will soak up anything from one-fifth to one-third
of their incomes, and, even allowing for a large
swelling of those incomes from war savings, so
that a great deal of what the State takes with one
hand she will return to the investing public with
the other, the diminution of purchasing power is
bound to make itself increasingly felt. When
the reconversion of machinery to civil ends has
been completed, the immediate arrears of demand
supplied, shipping and rolling-stock replaced,
houses built, repairs made good, and so forth, this
slow shrinkage of purchasing power in every
country will go hand in hand with shrinkage of
demand, decline of trade and wages, and unemployment,
in a slow process, till they culminate
in what one fears may be the worst "times" we
have ever known. Whether those "times" will
set in one, two, or even six years after the war,
is, of course, the question. A certain school of
thought insists that this tremendous taxation
after the war, and the consequent impoverishment
of enterprise and industry, can be avoided,
or at all events greatly relieved, by national
schemes for the development of the Empire's
latent resources; in other words, that the State
should even borrow more money to avoid high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
taxation and pay the interests on existing loans,
should acquire native lands, and swiftly develop
mineral rights and other potentialities. I hope
there may be something in this, but I am a little
afraid that the wish is father to the thought, and
that the proposition contains an element akin to
the attempt to lift oneself up by the hair of one's
own head; for I notice that many of its disciples
are recruited from those who in old days were
opposed to the State development of anything,
on the ground that individual energy in free competition
was a still greater driving power.</p>

<p>However we may wriggle in our skins and juggle
with the chances of the future, I suspect that
we shall have to pay the piper. We have without
doubt, during the war, been living to a great
extent on our capital. Our national income has
gone up, <i>out of capital</i>, from twenty-two hundred
to about three thousand six hundred millions,
and will rapidly shrink to an appropriate figure.
Wealth may, I admit, recover much more quickly
than deductions from the past would lead us to
expect. Under the war's pressure secrets have
been discovered, machinery improved, men's
energies and knowledge brightened and toned up.
The Prime Minister not long ago said: "If you
insist on going back to pre-war conditions, then
God help this country!" A wise warning. If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
country could be got to pull together in an effort
to cope with peace as strenuous as our effort to
cope with the war has been one would not view
the economic future with disquietude. But one
is bound to point out that if the war has proved
anything it has proved that the British people
require a maximum of danger dangled in front of
their very noses before they can be roused to any
serious effort, and that danger in time of peace
has not the poster-like quality of danger in time
of war; it does not hit men in the eye, it does not
still differences of opinion, and party struggles,
by its scarlet insistence. I hope for, but frankly
do not see, the coming of an united national
effort demanding extra energy, extra organising
skill, extra patience, and extra self-sacrifice at a
time when the whole nation will feel that it has
earned a rest, and when the lid has once more
been taken off the political cauldron. I fancy,
dismally, that a people and a Press who have
become so used to combat and excitement will
demand and seek further combat and excitement,
and will take out this itch amongst themselves in
a fashion even more strenuous than before the
war. I am not here concerned to try to cheer or
depress for some immediate and excellent result,
as we have all got into the habit of doing during
the war, but to try to conjure truth out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
darkness of the future. The vast reconstructive
process which ought to be, and perhaps is, beginning
now will, I think, go ahead with vigour while
the war is on, and for some little time after; but
I fear it will then split into <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>, see-saw,
and come to something of a standstill.</p>

<p>These, so sketchily set down, are a few of the
probable items&mdash;credit and debit&mdash;in the industrial
situation which will await the soldier-workman
emerging from the war. A situation agitated,
cross-currented, bewildering, but busy, and
by no means economically tight at first, slowly
becoming less bewildering, gradually growing less
and less busy, till it reaches ultimately a bad era
of unemployment and social struggle. The soldier-workman
will go back, I believe, to two or
three years at least of good wages and plentiful
work. But when, after that, the pinch begins to
come, it will encounter the quicker, more resentful
blood of men who in the constant facing of
great danger have left behind them all fear of
consequences; of men who in the survival of one
great dislocation to their lives, have lost the
dread of other dislocations. The war will have
implanted a curious deep restlessness in the great
majority of soldier souls. Can the workmen of
the future possibly be as patient and law-abiding
as they were before the war, in the face of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
seems to them injustice? I don't think so. The
enemy will again be Fate&mdash;this time in the form
of capital, trying to down them; and the victory
they were conscious of gaining over Fate in the
war will have strengthened and quickened their
fibre to another fight, and another conquest.
The seeds of revolution are supposed to lie in
war. They lie there because war generally brings
in the long run economic stress, but also because
of the recklessness or "character"&mdash;call it what
you will&mdash;which the habitual facing of danger
develops. The self-control and self-respect which
military service under war conditions will have
brought to the soldier-workman will be an added
force in civil life; but it is a fallacy, I think, to
suppose, as some do, that it will be a force on the
side of established order. It is all a question of
allegiance, and the allegiance of the workman in
time of peace is not rendered to the State, but to
himself and his own class. To the service of that
class and the defence of its "rights" this new
force will be given. In measuring the possibilities
of revolution, the question of class rides paramount.
Many hold that the war is breaking
down social barriers and establishing comradeship,
through hardship and danger shared. For
the moment this is true. But whether that new
comradeship will stand any great pressure of economic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
stress after direct regimental relationship
between officer and man has ceased and the war
is becoming just a painful memory, is to me very
doubtful. But suppose that to some extent it
does stand, we have still the fact that the control
of industry and capital, even as long as ten years
after the war, will be mainly in the hands of men
who have not fought, of business men spared
from service either by age or by their too precious
commercial skill. Towards these the soldier-workman
will have no tender feelings, no
sense of comradeship. On the contrary&mdash;for
somewhere back of the mind of every workman
there is, even during his country's danger, a certain
doubt whether all war is not somehow
hatched by the aristocrats and plutocrats of one
side, or both. Other feelings obscure this instinct
during the struggle, but it is never quite
lost, and will spring up again the more confirmed
for its repression. That we can avoid a straitened
and serious time a few years hence I believe
impossible. Straitened times dismally divide the
classes. The war-investments of the working
class may ease things a little, but war-savings will
not affect the outlook of the soldier-workman, for
he will have no war-savings, except his life, and
it is from him that revolution or disorder will
come, if it come at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Must it come? I think most certainly, unless
between now and then means be found of persuading
capital and labour that their interests
and their troubles are identical, and of overcoming
secrecy and suspicion between them. There
are many signs already that capital and labour
are becoming alive to this necessity. But to talk
of unity is an amiable distraction in which we all
indulge these days. To find a method by which
that talk may be translated into fact within a few
years is perhaps more difficult. One does not
change human nature; and unless the interests of
capital and labour are <i>in reality</i> made one, true
co-operation established, and factory conditions
transformed on the lines of the welfare system&mdash;no
talk of unity will prevent capitalist and working
man from claiming what seem to them their
rights. The labour world is now, and for some
time to come will be, at sixes and sevens in matters
of leadership and responsibility; and this just
when sagacious leadership and loyal following
will be most needed. The soldier-workman was
already restive under leadership before the war;
returned to civil life, he will be far more restive.
Yet, without leadership, what hope is there of
co-operation with capital; what chance of finding
a golden mean of agreement? But even if the
problems of leadership are solved, and councils<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
of capitalists and labour leaders established, whose
decisions will be followed&mdash;one thing is still certain:
no half-measures will do; no seeming cordialities
with mental reservations; no simulated
generosity which spills out on the first test; nothing
but genuine friendliness and desire to pull
together. Those hard business heads which distrust
all sentiment as if it were a poison are the
most short-sighted heads in the world. There is
a human factor in this affair, as both sides will
find to their cost if they neglect it. Extremists
must be sent to Coventry, "caste" feeling dropped
on the one hand, and suspicion dropped on the
other; managers, directors, and labour leaders, all
must learn that they are not simply trustees for
their shareholders or for labour, but trustees of a
national interest which embraces them all&mdash;or
worse will come of it.</p>

<p>But I am not presumptuous enough to try to
teach these cooks how to make their broth, neither
would it come within the scope of these speculations,
which conclude thus: The soldier-workman,
physically unchanged, mentally a little weakened,
but more "characterful" and restive, will step
out through a demobilisation&mdash;heaven send it be
swift, even at some risk!&mdash;into an industrial
world, confused and busy as a beehive, which
will hum and throb and flourish for two or three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
years, and then slowly chill and thin away into,
may be, the winter ghost of itself, or at best an
autumn hive. There, unless he be convinced,
not by words but facts, that his employer is
standing side by side with him in true comradeship,
facing the deluge, he will be quick to rise,
and with his newly-found self-confidence take
things into his own hands. Whether, if he does,
he will make those things better for himself would
be another inquiry altogether.</p>

<h2>THE CHILDREN'S JEWEL FUND</h2>

<p>The mere male novelist who takes pen to write
on infants awaits the polished comment: "He
knows nothing of the subject&mdash;rubbish; pure rubbish!"
One must run that risk.</p>

<p>In the report of the National Baby Week it is
written:&mdash;"Is it worth while to destroy our best
manhood now unless we can ensure that there
will be happy, healthy citizens to carry on the
Empire in the future?" I confess to approaching
this subject from the point of view of the infant
citizen rather than of the Empire. And I have
wondered sometimes if it is worth while to save
the babies, seeing the conditions they often have
to face as grown men and women. But that,
after all, would be to throw up the sponge, which
is not the part of a Briton. It is written also:&mdash;"After
the war a very large increase in the birth-rate
may be looked for." For a year or two, perhaps;
but the real after-effect of the war will be
to decrease the birth-rate in every European
country, or I am much mistaken. "No food for
cannon, and no extra burdens," will be the cry.
And little wonder! This, however, does not
affect the question of children actually born or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
on their way. If not quantity, we can at all
events have quality.</p>

<p>I also read an account of the things to be done
to keep "baby" alive, which filled me with wonder
how any of us old babies managed to survive,
and I am afraid that unless we grow up healthy
we are not worth the trouble. The fact is: The
whole business of babies is an activity to be
engaged in with some regard to the baby, or we
commit a monstrous injustice, and drag the hands
of the world's clock backwards.</p>

<p>How do things stand? Each year in this country
about 100,000 babies die before they have
come into the world; and out of the 800,000 born,
about 90,000 die. Many mothers become permanently
damaged in health by evil birth conditions.
Many children grow up mentally or physically
defective. One in four of the children in
our elementary schools are not in a condition to
benefit properly by their schooling. What sublime
waste! Ten in a hundred of them suffer
from malnutrition; thirty in the hundred have
defective eyes; eighty in the hundred need dental
treatment; twenty odd in the hundred have enlarged
tonsils or adenoids. Many, perhaps most,
of these deaths and defects are due to the avoidable
ignorance, ill-health, mitigable poverty, and
other handicaps which dog poor mothers before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
and after a baby's birth. One doesn't know
which to pity most&mdash;the mothers or the babies.
Fortunately, to help the one is to help the other.
In passing I would like to record two sentiments:
my strong impression that we ought to follow the
example of America and establish Mothers' Pensions;
and my strong hope that those who visit
the sins of the fathers upon illegitimate children
will receive increasingly the contempt they deserve
from every decent-minded citizen.</p>

<p>On the general question of improving the health
of mothers and babies I would remind readers
that there is no great country where effort is half
so much needed as here; we are nearly twice as
town and slum ridden as any other people; have
grown to be further from nature and more feckless
about food; we have damper air to breathe,
and less sun to disinfect us. In New Zealand,
with a climate somewhat similar to ours, the infant
mortality rate has, as a result of a widespread
educational campaign, been reduced within
the last few years to 50 per 1,000 from 110 per
1,000 a few years ago. It is perhaps too sanguine
to expect that we, so much more town-ridden,
can do as well here, but we ought to be able to
make a vast improvement. We have begun to.
Since 1904, when this matter was first seriously
taken in hand, our infant mortality rate has declined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
from 145 per 1,000 to 91 per 1,000 in 1916.
This reduction has been mainly due to the institution
of infant welfare centres and whole-time
health visitors. Of centres there are now nearly
1,200. We want 5,000 more. Of visitors there
are now hardly 1,500. We want, I am told, 2,000
more. It is estimated that the yearly crop of
babies, 700,000, if those of the well-to-do be
excepted, can be provided with infant welfare
centres and whole-time health visitors by expenditure
at the rate of £1 a head per year. The
Government, which is benevolently disposed
towards the movement, gives half of the annual
expenditure; the other half falls on the municipalities.
But these 5,000 new infant welfare centres
and these extra 2,000 health visitors must be
started by voluntary effort and subscription.
Once started, the Government and the municipalities
will have to keep them up; but unless we
start them, the babies will go on dying or growing
up diseased. The object of the Jewel Fund,
therefore, is to secure the necessary money to get
the work into train.</p>

<p>What are these Infant Welfare Centres, and
have they really all this magic? They are places
where mothers to be, or in being, can come for
instruction and help in all that concerns birth
and the care of their babies and children up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
school age. "Prevention is better than cure," is
the motto of these Centres. I went to one of
the largest in London. It has about 600 entries
in the year. There were perhaps 40 babies and
children and perhaps 30 mothers there. About 20
of these mothers were learning sewing or knitting.
Five of them were sitting round a nurse who was
bathing a three-weeks-old baby. The young
mother who can wash a baby to the taste and
benefit of the baby by the light of nature must
clearly be something of a phenomenon. In a
room downstairs were certain little stoics whose
health was poor; they were brought there daily
to be watched. One was an air-raid baby, the
thinnest little critter ever seen; an ashen bit of a
thing through which the wind could blow; very
silent, and asking "Why?" with its eyes. They
showed me a mother who had just lost her first
baby. The Centre was rescuing it from a pauper's
funeral. I can see her now, coming in and
sitting on the edge of a chair; the sudden puckering
of her dried-up little face, the tears rolling
down. I shall always remember the tone of her
voice&mdash;"It's my <i>baby</i>." Her husband is "doing
time"; and want of food and knowledge while she
was "carrying it" caused the baby's death. Several
mothers from her street come to the Centre;
but, "keeping herself to herself," she never heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
of it till too late. In a hundred little ways these
Centres give help and instruction. They, and
the Health Visitors who go along with them, are
doing a great work; but there are many districts
all over the country where there are no Centres
to come to; no help and instruction to be got,
however desperately wanted. Verily this land of
ours still goes like Rachel mourning for her children.
Disease, hunger, deformity, and death still
hound our babes, and most of that hounding is
avoidable. We must and shall revolt against the
evil lot, which preventible ignorance, ill health,
and poverty bring on hundreds of thousands of
children.</p>

<p>It is time we had more pride. What right have
we to the word "civilised" till we give mothers
and children a proper chance? This is but the
Alpha of decency, the first step of progress. We
are beginning to realise that; but, even now, to
make a full effort and make it at once&mdash;we have
to beg for jewels.</p>

<p>What's a jewel beside a baby's life? What's a
toy to the health and happy future of these helpless
little folk?</p>

<p>You who wear jewels, with few exceptions, are
or will be mothers&mdash;you ought to know. To help
your own children you would strip yourselves.
But the test is the giving for children not one's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
own. Beneath all flaws, fatuities, and failings,
this, I solemnly believe, is the country of the
great-hearted. I believe that the women of our
race, before all women, have a sense of others.
They will not fail the test.</p>

<p>Into the twilight of the world are launched
each year these myriads of tiny ships. Under a
sky of cloud and stars they grope out to the great
waters and the great winds&mdash;little sloops of life,
on whose voyaging the future hangs. They go
forth blind, feeling their way. Mothers, and you
who will be mothers, and you who have missed
motherhood, give them their chance, bless them
with a gem&mdash;light their lanterns with your jewels!</p>

<h2>FRANCE, 1916&ndash;1917</h2>

<h3>AN IMPRESSION</h3>

<p>It was past eleven, and the packet had been
steady some time when we went on deck and
found her moving slowly in bright moonlight up
the haven towards the houses of Le Havre. A
night approach to a city by water has the quality
of other-worldness. I remember the same
sensation twice before: coming in to San Francisco
from the East by the steam-ferry, and stealing
into Abingdon-on-Thames in a rowing-boat.
Le Havre lay, reaching up towards the heights,
still and fair, a little mysterious, with many
lights which no one seemed using. It was cold,
but the air already had a different texture, drier,
lighter than the air we had left, and one's heart
felt light and a little excited. In the moonlight
the piled-up, shuttered houses had colouring like
that of flowers at night&mdash;pale, subtle, mother-o'-pearl.
We moved slowly up beside the quay,
heard the first French voices, saw the first French
faces, and went down again to sleep.</p>

<p>In the Military Bureau at the station, with
what friendly politeness they exchanged our hospital
passes for the necessary forms; but it took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
two officials ten minutes of hard writing! And
one thought: Is victory possible with all these
forms? It is so throughout France&mdash;too many
forms, too many people to fill them up. As if
France could not trust herself without recording
in spidery handwriting exactly where she is, for
nobody to look at afterwards. But France <i>could</i>
trust herself. A pity!</p>

<p>Our only fellow-traveller was not a soldier, but
had that indefinable look of connection with the
war wrapped round almost everyone in France.
A wide land we passed, fallow under the November
sky; houses hidden among the square Normandy
court-yards of tall trees; not many people
in the fields.</p>

<p>Paris is Paris, was, and ever shall be! Paris is
not France. If the Germans had taken Paris they
would have occupied the bodily heart, the centre
of her circulatory system; but the spirit of France
their heavy hands would not have clutched, for
it never dwelt there. Paris is hard and hurried;
France is not. Paris loves pleasure; France loves
life. Paris is a brilliant stranger in her own land.
And yet a lot of true Frenchmen and Frenchwomen
live there, and many little plots of real
French life are cultivated.</p>

<p>At the Gare de Lyon <i>poilus</i> are taking trains
for the South. This is our first real sight of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
in their tired glory. They look weary and dusty
and strong; every face has character, no face
looks empty or as if its thought were being done
by others. Their laughter is not vulgar or thick.
Alongside their faces the English face looks stupid,
the English body angular and&mdash;neat. They are
loaded with queer burdens, bread and bottles
bulge their pockets; their blue-grey is prettier
than khaki, their round helmets are becoming.
Our Tommies, even to our own eyes, seem uniformed,
but hardly two out of all this crowd are
dressed alike. The French soldier luxuriates in
extremes; he can go to his death in white gloves
and dandyism&mdash;he can glory in unshavenness and
patches. The words <i>in extremis</i> seem dear to the
French soldier; and, <i>con amore</i>, he passes from
one extreme to the other. One of them stands
gazing up at the board which gives the hours of
starting and the destinations of the trains. His
tired face is charming, and has a look that I cannot
describe&mdash;lost, as it were, to all surroundings;
a Welshman or a Highlander, but no pure Englishman,
could look like that.</p>

<p>Our carriage has four French officers; they talk
neither to us nor to each other; they sleep, sitting
well back, hardly moving all night; one of them
snores a little, but with a certain politeness. We
leave them in the early morning and get down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
into the windy station at Valence. In pre-war
days romance began there when one journeyed.
A lovely word, and the gate of the South. Soon
after Valence one used to wake and draw aside a
corner of the curtain and look at the land in the
first level sunlight; a strange land of plains, and
far, yellowish hills, a land with a dry, shivering
wind over it, and puffs of pink almond blossom.
But now Valence was dark, for it was November,
and raining. In the waiting-room were three
tired soldiers trying to sleep, and one sitting up
awake, shyly glad to share our cakes and journals.
Then on through the wet morning by the little
branch line into Dauphiné. Two officers again
and a civilian, in our carriage, are talking in low
voices of the war, or in higher voices of lodgings
at Valence. One is a commandant, with a handsome
paternal old face, broader than the English
face, a little more in love with life, and a little
more cynical about it, with more depth of colouring
in eyes and cheeks and hair. The tone of
their voices, talking of the war, is grave and
secret. "<i>Les Anglais ne lâcheront pas</i>" are the
only words I plainly hear. The younger officer
says: "And how would you punish?" The commandant's
answer is inaudible, but by the twinkling
of his eyes one knows it to be human and
sagacious. The train winds on in the windy wet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
through foothills and then young mountains, following
up a swift-flowing river. The chief trees
are bare Lombardy poplars. The chief little town
is gathered round a sharp spur, with bare towers
on its top. The colour everywhere is a brownish-grey.</p>

<p>We have arrived. A tall, strong young soldier,
all white teeth and smiles, hurries our luggage
out, a car hurries us up in the rainy wind through
the little town, down again across the river, up a
long avenue of pines, and we are at our hospital.</p>

<p>Round the long table, at their dinner-hour,
what a variety of type among the men! And yet
a likeness, a sort of quickness and sensibility,
common to them all. A few are a little <i>méfiant</i> of
these newcomers, with the <i>méfiance</i> of individual
character, not of class distrustfulness, nor of that
defensive expressionless we cultivate in England.
The French soldier has a touch of the child in
him&mdash;if we leave out the Parisians; a child who
knows more than you do perhaps; a child who
has lived many lives before this life; a wise child,
who jumps to your moods and shows you his
"sore fingers" readily when he feels that you
want to see them. He has none of the perverse
and grudging attitude towards his own ailments
that we English foster. He is perhaps a little
inclined to pet them, treating them with an odd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
mixture of stoic gaiety and gloomy indulgence.
It is like all the rest of him; he feels everything so
much quicker than we do&mdash;he is so much more
impressionable. The variety of type is more
marked physically than in our country. Here is
a tall Savoyard cavalryman, with a maimed hand
and a fair moustache brushed up at the ends,
big and strong, with grey eyes, and a sort of sage
self-reliance; only twenty-six, but might be forty.
Here is a real Latin, who was buried by an explosion
at Verdun; handsome, with dark hair and
a round head, and colour in his cheeks; an ironical
critic of everything, a Socialist, a mocker, a fine,
strong fellow with a clear brain, who attracts
women. Here are two peasants from the Central
South, both with bad sciatica, slower in look,
with a mournful, rather monkeyish expression in
their eyes, as if puzzled by their sufferings. Here
is a true Frenchman, a Territorial, from Roanne,
riddled with rheumatism, quick and gay, and suffering,
touchy and affectionate, not tall, brown-faced,
brown-eyed, rather fair, with clean jaw
and features, and eyes with a soul in them, looking
a little up; forty-eight&mdash;the oldest of them all&mdash;they
call him <i>Grandpère</i>. And here is a printer
from Lyon with shell-shock; medium-coloured,
short and roundish and neat, full of humanity
and high standards and domestic affection, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
so polite, with eyes a little like a dog's. And here
another with shell-shock and brown-green eyes,
from the "invaded countries"; <i>méfiant</i>, truly, this
one, but with a heart when you get at it; neat,
and brooding, quick as a cat, nervous, and wanting
his own way. But they are all so varied. If
there are qualities common to all they are impressionability
and capacity for affection. This
is not the impression left on one by a crowd of
Englishmen. Behind the politeness and civilised
bearing of the French I used to think there was
a little of the tiger. In a sense perhaps there is,
but that is not the foundation of their character&mdash;far
from it! Underneath the tiger, again, there
is a man civilised for centuries. Most certainly
the politeness of the French is no surface quality,
it is a polish welling up from a naturally affectionate
heart, a naturally quick apprehension of
the moods and feelings of others; it is the outcome
of a culture so old that, underneath all differences,
it binds together all those types and strains of
blood&mdash;the Savoyard, and the Southerner, the
Latin of the Centre, the man from the North, the
Breton, the Gascon, the Basque, the Auvergnat,
even to some extent the Norman, and the Parisian&mdash;in
a sort of warm and bone-deep kinship.
They have all, as it were, sat for centuries under
a wall with the afternoon sun warming them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
through and through, as I so often saw the old
town gossips sitting of an afternoon. The sun
of France has made them alike; a light and
happy sun, not too southern, but just southern
enough.</p>

<p>And the women of France! If the men are
bound in that mysterious kinship, how much
more so are the women! What is it in the
Frenchwoman which makes her so utterly unique?
A daughter in one of Anatole France's books says
to her mother: "<i>Tu es pour les bijoux, je suis pour
les dessous</i>." The Frenchwoman spiritually is
<i>pour les dessous</i>. There is in her a kind of inherited,
conservative, clever, dainty capability;
no matter where you go in France, or in what
class&mdash;country or town&mdash;you find it. She cannot
waste, she cannot spoil, she makes and shows&mdash;the
best of everything. If I were asked for a
concrete illustration of self-respect I should say&mdash;the
Frenchwoman. It is a particular kind of
self-respect, no doubt, very much limited to this
world; and perhaps beginning to be a little frayed.
We have some Frenchwomen at the hospital, the
servants who keep us in running order&mdash;the dear
cook whom we love not only for her baked meats,
proud of her soldier son once a professor, now a
sergeant, and she a woman of property, with
two houses in the little town; patient, kind, very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
stubborn about her dishes, which have in them
the essential juices and savours which characterise
all things really French. She has great sweetness
and self-containment in her small, wrinkled,
yellowish face; always quietly polite and grave,
she bubbles deliciously at any joke, and gives
affection sagaciously to those who merit. A
jewel, who must be doing something <i>pour la
France</i>. And we have Madame Jeanne Camille,
mother of two daughters and one son, too young
to be a soldier. It was her eldest daughter who
wanted to come and scrub in the hospital, but
was refused because she was too pretty. And
her mother came instead. A woman who did
not need to come, and nearly fifty, but strong,
as the French are strong, with good red blood,
deep colouring, hair still black, and handsome
straight features. What a worker! A lover of
talk, too, and of a joke when she has time. And
Claire, of a <i>languissante</i> temperament, as she
says; but who would know it? Eighteen, with a
figure abundant as that of a woman of forty, but
just beginning to fine down; holding herself as
French girls learn to hold themselves so young;
and with the pretty eyes of a Southern nymph,
clear-brown and understanding, and a little bit
wood-wild. Not self-conscious&mdash;like the English
girl at that age&mdash;fond of work and play; with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
what is called "a good head" on her, and a warm
heart. A real woman of France.</p>

<p>Then there is the "farmeress" at the home
farm which gives the hospital its milk; a splendid,
grey-eyed creature, doing the work of her husband
who is at the front, with a little girl and
boy rounder and rosier than anything you ever
saw; and a small, one-eyed brother-in-law who
drinks. My God, he drinks! Any day you go
into the town to do hospital commissions you
may see the hospital donkey-cart with the charming
grey donkey outside the Café de l'Univers or
what not, and know that Charles is within. He
beguiles our <i>poilus</i>, and they take little beguiling.
Wine is too plentiful in France. The sun in the
wines of France quickens and cheers the blood in
the veins of France. But the gift of wine is
abused. One may see a poster which says&mdash;with
what truth I know not&mdash;that drink has cost
France more than the Franco-Prussian War.
French drunkenness is not so sottish as our beer-and-whiskey-fuddled
variety, but it is not pleasant
to see, and mars a fair land.</p>

<p>What a fair land! I never before grasped the
charm of French colouring; the pinkish-yellow of
the pan-tiled roofs, the lavender-grey or dim
green of the shutters, the self-respecting shapes
and flatness of the houses, unworried by wriggling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
ornamentation or lines coming up in order that
they may go down again; the universal plane
trees with their variegated trunks and dancing
lightness&mdash;nothing more charming than plane trees
in winter, their delicate twigs and little brown
balls shaking against the clear pale skies, and in
summer nothing more green and beautiful than
their sun-flecked shade. Each country has its
special genius of colouring&mdash;best displayed in
winter. To characterise such genius by a word
or two is hopeless; but one might say the genius
of Spain is brown; of Ireland green; of England
chalky blue-green; of Egypt shimmering sandstone.
For France amethystine feebly expresses
the sensation; the blend is subtle, stimulating,
rarefied&mdash;at all events in the centre and south.
Walk into an English village, however beautiful&mdash;and
many are very beautiful&mdash;you will not get
the peculiar sharp spiritual sensation which will
come on you entering some little French village
or town&mdash;the sensation one has looking at a picture
by Francesca. The blue wood-smoke, the
pinkish tiles, the grey shutters, the grey-brown
plane trees, the pale blue sky, the yellowish
houses, and above all the clean forms and the
clear air. I shall never forget one late afternoon
rushing home in the car from some commission.
The setting sun had just broken through after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
misty day, the mountains were illumined with
purple and rose-madder, and snow-tipped against
the blue sky, a wonderful wistaria blue drifted
smoke-like about the valley; and the tall trees&mdash;poplars
and cypresses&mdash;stood like spires. No
wonder the French are <i>spirituel</i>, a word so different
from our "spiritual," for that they are not;
pre-eminently citizens of this world&mdash;even the
pious French. This is why on the whole they
make a better fist of social life than we do, we
misty islanders, only half-alive because we set
such store by our unrealised moralities. Not one
Englishman in ten now <i>really</i> believes that he is
going to live again, but his disbelief has not yet
reconciled him to making the best of this life, or
laid ghosts of the beliefs he has outworn. Clear
air and sun, but not so much as to paralyse action,
have made in France clearer eyes, clearer brains,
and touched souls with a sane cynicism. The
French do not despise and neglect the means to
ends. They face sexual realities. They know
that to live well they must eat well, to eat well
must cook well, to cook well must cleanly and
cleverly cultivate their soil. May France be
warned in time by our dismal fate! May she
never lose her love of the land; nor let industrialism
absorb her peasantry, and the lure of wealth
and the cheap glamour of the towns draw her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
into their uncharmed circles. We English have
rattled deep into a paradise of machines, chimneys,
cinemas, and halfpenny papers; have bartered
our heritage of health, dignity, and looks
for wealth, and badly distributed wealth at that.
France was trembling on the verge of the same
precipice when the war came; with its death and
wind of restlessness the war bids fair to tip her
over. Let her hold back with all her might!
Her two dangers are drink and the lure of the
big towns. No race can preserve sanity and refinement
which really gives way to these. She
will not fare even as well as we have if she yields;
our fibre is coarser and more resistant than hers,
nor had we ever so much grace to lose. It is by
grace and self-respect that France had her pre-eminence;
let these wither, as wither they must
in the grip of a sordid and drink-soothed industrialism,
and her star will burn out. The life of
the peasant is hard; peasants are soon wrinkled
and weathered; they are not angels; narrow and
over-provident, suspicious, and given to drink,
they still have their roots and being in the realities
of life, close to nature, and keep a sort of
simple dignity and health which great towns
destroy. Let France take care of her peasants
and her country will take care of itself.</p>

<p>Talking to our <i>poilus</i> we remarked that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
have not a good word to throw to their <i>députés</i>&mdash;no
faith in them. About French politicians I
know nothing; but their shoes are unenviable, and
will become too tight for them after the war.
The <i>poilu</i> has no faith at all now, if he ever had,
save faith in his country, so engrained that he
lets the life-loving blood of him be spilled out to
the last drop, cursing himself and everything for
his heroic folly.</p>

<p>We had a young Spaniard of the Foreign Legion
in our hospital who had been to Cambridge, and
had the "outside" eyes on all things French. In
his view <i>je m'en foutism</i> has a hold of the French
army. Strange if it had not! Clear, quick
brains cannot stand Fate's making ninepins of
mankind year after year like this. Fortunately
for France, the love of her sons has never been
forced; it has grown like grass and simple wild
herbs in the heart, alongside the liberty to criticise
and blame. The <i>poilu</i> cares for nothing, no,
not he! But he is himself a little, unconscious
bit of France, and, for oneself, one always cares.
State-forced patriotism made this war&mdash;a fever-germ
which swells the head and causes blindness.
A State which teaches patriotism in its schools is
going mad! Let no such State be trusted!
They who, after the war, would have England
and France copy the example of the State-drilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
country which opened these flood-gates of death,
and teach mad provincialism under the nickname
of patriotism to their children, are driving nails
into the coffins of their countries. <i>Je m'en foutism</i>
is a natural product of three years of war, and
better by far than the docile despair to which so
many German soldiers have been reduced. We
were in Lyon when the Russian Revolution and
the German retreat from Bapaume were reported.
The town and railway station were full of soldiers.
No enthusiasm, no stir of any kind, only the usual
tired stoicism. And one thought of what the
<i>poilu</i> can be like; of our Christmas dinner-table
at the hospital under the green hanging wreaths
and the rosy Chinese lanterns, the hum, the chatter,
the laughter of free and easy souls in their
red hospital jackets. The French are so easily,
so incorrigibly gay; the dreary grinding pressure
of this war seems horribly cruel applied to such a
people, and the heroism with which they have
borne its untold miseries is sublime. In our little
remote town out there&mdash;a town which had been
Roman in its time, and still had bits of Roman
walls and Roman arches&mdash;every family had its
fathers, brothers, sons, dead, fighting, in prison, or
in hospital. The mothers were wonderful. One
old couple, in a <i>ferblanterie</i> shop, who had lost
their eldest son and whose other son was at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
front, used to try hard not to talk about the war,
but sure enough they would come to it at last, each
time we saw them, and in a minute the mother
would be crying and a silent tear would roll down
the old father's face. Then he would point to the
map and say: "But look where they are, the
Boches! Can we stop? It's impossible. We
must go on till we've thrown them out. It is
dreadful, but what would you have? Ah! Our
son&mdash;he was so promising!" And the mother,
weeping over the tin-tacks, would make the neatest
little parcel of them, murmuring out of her
tears: "<i>Il faut que ça finisse; mais la France&mdash;il
ne faut pas que la France&mdash;Nos chers fils auraient
été tués pour rien!</i>" Poor souls! I remember
another couple up on the hillside. The old wife,
dignified as a duchess&mdash;if duchesses are dignified&mdash;wanting
us so badly to come in and sit down that
she might the better talk to us of her sons: one
dead, and one wounded, and two still at the front,
and the youngest not yet old enough. And while
we stood there up came the father, an old farmer,
with that youngest son. He had not quite the
spirit of the old lady, nor her serenity; he thought
that men in these days were no better than <i>des
bêtes féroces</i>. And in truth his philosophy&mdash;of an
old tiller of the soil&mdash;was as superior to that of
emperors and diplomats as his life is superior to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
theirs. Not very far from that little farm is the
spot of all others in that mountain country which
most stirs the æsthetic and the speculative strains
within one. Lovely and remote, all by itself at
the foot of a mountain, in a circle of the hills,
an old monastery stands, now used as a farm,
with one rose window, like a spider's web, spun
delicate in stone tracery. There the old monks
had gone to get away from the struggles of the
main valley and the surges of the fighting men.
There even now were traces of their peaceful
life; the fish-ponds and the tillage still kept in
cultivation. If they had lived in these days
they would have been at the war, fighting or
bearing stretchers, like the priests of France, of
whom eleven thousand, I am told&mdash;untruthfully,
I hope&mdash;are dead. So the world goes forward&mdash;the
Kingdom of Heaven comes!</p>

<p>We were in the town the day that the 1918
class received their preliminary summons. Sad
were the mothers watching their boys parading
the streets, rosetted and singing to show that
they had passed and were ready to be food for
cannon. Not one of those boys, I dare say, in his
heart wanted to go; they have seen too many of
their brethren return war-worn, missed too many
who will never come back. But they were no less
gay about it than those recruits we saw in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
spring of 1913, at Argelès in the Pyrenees, singing
along and shouting on the day of their enrolment.</p>

<p>There were other reminders to us, and to the
little town, of the blood-red line drawn across the
map of France. We had in our hospital men
from the invaded countries without news of wives
and families mured up behind that iron veil.
Once in a way a tiny word would get through to
them, and anxiety would lift a little from their
hearts; for a day or two they would smile. One
we had, paralysed in the legs, who would sit doing
macramé work and playing chess all day long;
every relative he had&mdash;wife, father, mother, sisters&mdash;all
were in the power of the German. As
brave a nature as one could see in a year's march,
touchingly grateful, touchingly cheerful, but with
the saddest eyes I ever saw. There was one little
reminder in the town whom we could never
help going in to look at whenever we passed the
shop whose people had given her refuge. A little
girl of eight with the most charming, grave, pale,
little, grey-eyed face; there she would sit, playing
with her doll, watching the customers. That little
refugee at all events was beloved and happy;
only I think she thought we would kidnap her
one day&mdash;we stared at her so hard. She had the
quality which gives to certain faces the fascination
belonging to rare works of art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>With all this poignant bereavement and long-suffering
amongst them it would be odd indeed if
the gay and critical French nature did not rebel,
and seek some outlet in apathy or bitter criticism.
The miracle is that they go on and on holding
fast. Easily depressed, and as easily lifted up
again, grumble they must and will; but their
hearts are not really down to the pitch of their
voices; their love of country, which with them is
love of self&mdash;the deepest of all kinds of patriotism&mdash;is
too absolute. These two virtues or vices (as
you please)&mdash;critical faculty and <i>amour propre</i>
or vanity, if you prefer it&mdash;are in perpetual encounter.
The French are at once not at all
proud of themselves and very proud. They destroy
all things French, themselves included, with
their brains and tongues, and exalt the same with
their hearts and by their actions. To the reserved
English mind, always on the defensive,
they seem to give themselves away continually;
but he who understands sees it to be all part of
that perpetual interplay of opposites which makes
up the French character and secures for it in
effect a curious vibrating equilibrium. "Intensely
alive" is the chief impression one has of
the French. They balance between head and
heart at top speed in a sort of electric and eternal
see-saw. It is this perpetual quick change which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
gives them, it seems to me, their special grip on
actuality; they never fly into the cloud-regions of
theories and dreams; their heads have not time
before their hearts have intervened, their hearts
not time before their heads cry: "Hold!" They
apprehend both worlds, but with such rapid
alternation that they surrender to neither. Consider
how clever and comparatively warm is that
cold thing "religion" in France. I remember so
well the old <i>curé</i> of our little town coming up to
lunch, his interest in the cooking, in the practical
matters of our life, and in wider affairs too; his
enjoyment of his coffee and cigarette; and the
curious suddenness with which something seemed
"to come over him"&mdash;one could hear his heart
saying: "O my people, here am I wasting my
time; I must run to you." I saw him in the
court-yard talking to one of our <i>poilus</i>, not about
his soul, but about his body; stroking his shoulder
softly and calling him <i>mon cher fils</i>. Dear old
man! Even religion here does not pretend to
more than it can achieve&mdash;help and consolation
to the bewildered and the suffering. It uses
forms, smiling a little at them.</p>

<p>The secret of French culture lies in this vibrating
balance; from quick marriage of mind and
heart, reason and sense, in the French nature, all
the clear created forms of French life arise, forms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
recognised as forms with definite utility attached.
Controlled expression is the result of action and
reaction. Controlled expression is the essence
of culture, because it alone makes a sufficiently
clear appeal in a world which is itself the result
of the innumerable interplay of complementary
or dual laws and forces. French culture is near
to the real heart of things, because it has a sort
of quick sanity which never loses its way; or,
when it does, very rapidly recovers the middle
of the road. It has the two capital defects of its
virtues. It is too fond of forms and too mistrustful.
The French nature is sane and cynical.
Well, it's natural! The French lie just halfway
between north and south; their blood is too
mingled for enthusiasm, and their culture too
old.</p>

<p>I never realised how old France was till we
went to Arles. In our crowded train <i>poilus</i> were
packed, standing in the corridors. One very
weary, invited by a high and kindly colonel into
our carriage, chatted in his tired voice of how
wonderfully the women kept the work going on
the farms. "When we get a fortnight's leave,"
he said, "all goes well, we can do the heavy things
the women cannot, and the land is made clean.
It wants that fortnight now and then, <i>mon colonel</i>;
there is work on farms that women cannot do."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
And the colonel vehemently nodded his thin face.
We alighted in the dark among southern forms
and voices, and the little hotel omnibus became
enmeshed at once in old, high, very narrow,
Italian-seeming streets. It was Sunday next day;
sunny, with a clear blue sky. In the square before
our hotel a simple crowd round the statue of
Mistral chattered or listened to a girl singing
excruciating songs; a crowd as old-looking as in
Italy or Spain, aged as things only are in the
South. We walked up to the Arena. Quite a
recent development in the life of Arles, they say,
that marvellous Roman building, here cut down,
there built up, by Saracen hands. For a thousand
years or more before the Romans came
Arles flourished and was civilised. What had we
mushroom islanders before the Romans came?
What had barbaric Prussia? Not even the Romans
to look forward to! The age-long life of
the South stands for much in modern France,
correcting the cruder blood which has poured in
these last fifteen hundred years. As one blends
wine of very old stock with newer brands, so has
France been blended and mellowed. A strange
cosmic feeling one had, on the top of the great
building in that town older than Rome itself, of
the continuity of human life and the futility of
human conceit. The provincial vanity of modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
States looked pitiful in the clear air above
that vast stony proof of age.</p>

<p>In many ways the war has brought us up all
standing on the edge of an abyss. When it is
over shall we go galloping over the edge, or, reining
back, sit awhile in our saddles looking for a
better track? We were all on the highway to a
hell of material expansion and vulgarity, of cheap
immediate profit, and momentary sensation;
north and south in our different ways, all "rattling
into barbarity." Shall we find our way
again into a finer air, where self-respect, not profit,
rules, and rare things and durable are made once
more?</p>

<p>From Arles we journeyed to Marseilles, to see
how the first cosmopolitan town in the world
fared in war-time. Here was an amazing spectacle
of swarming life. If France has reason to
feel the war most of all the great countries, Marseilles
must surely feel it less than any other
great town; she flourishes in a perfect riot of
movement and colour. Here all the tribes are
met, save those of Central Europe&mdash;Frenchman,
Serb, Spaniard, Algerian, Greek, Arab, Khabyle,
Russian, Indian, Italian, Englishman, Scotsman,
Jew, and Nubian rub shoulders in the thronged
streets. The miles of docks are crammed with
ships. Food of all sorts abounds. In the bright,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
dry light all is gay and busy. The most æsthetic,
and perhaps most humiliating, sight that a Westerner
could see we came on there: two Arab Spahis
walking down the main street in their long robe
uniforms, white and red, and their white linen
bonnets bound with a dark fur and canting
slightly backwards. Over six feet high, they
moved unhurrying, smoking their cigarettes,
turning their necks slowly from side to side like
camels of the desert. Their brown, thin, bearded
faces wore neither scorn nor interest, only a
superb self-containment; but, beside them, every
other specimen of the human race seemed cheap
and negligible. God knows of what they were
thinking&mdash;as little probably as the smoke they
blew through their chiselled nostrils&mdash;but their
beauty and grace were unsurpassable. And,
visioning our western and northern towns and the
little, white, worried abortions they breed, one
felt downcast and abashed.</p>

<p>Marseilles swarmed with soldiers; Lyon, Valence,
Arles, even the smallest cities swarmed with
soldiers, and this at the moment when the Allied
offensive was just beginning. If France be nearing
the end of her man-power, as some assert, she
conceals it so that one would think she was at
the beginning.</p>

<p>From Marseilles we went to Lyon. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
heard that town described as lamentably plain;
but compared with Manchester or Sheffield it is
as heaven to hell. Between its two wide rolling
rivers, under a line of heights, it has somewhat
the aspect of an enormous commercialised Florence.
Perhaps in foggy weather it may be
dreary, but the sky was blue and the sun shone,
a huge <i>Foire</i> was just opening, and every street
bustled in a dignified manner.</p>

<p>The English have always had a vague idea that
France is an immoral country. To the eye of a
mere visitor France is the most moral of the four
Great Powers&mdash;France, Russia, England, Germany;
has the strongest family life and the most
seemly streets. Young men and maidens are
never seen walking or lying about, half-embraced,
as in puritanical England. Fire is not played
with&mdash;openly, at least. The slow-fly amorousness
of the British working classes evidently does
not suit the quicker blood of France. There is
just enough of the South in the French to keep
demonstration of affection away from daylight.
A certain school of French novelist, with high-coloured
tales of Parisian life, is responsible for
his country's reputation. Whatever the Frenchman
about town may be, he seems by no means
typical of the many millions of Frenchmen who
are not about town. And if Frenchwomen, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
have heard Frenchmen say, are <i>légères</i>, they are
the best mothers in the world, and their "lightness"
is not vulgarly obtruded. They say many
domestic tragedies will be played at the conclusion
of the war. If so, they will not be played
in France alone; and compared with the tragedies
of fidelity played all these dreadful years they
will be as black rabbits to brown for numbers.
For the truth on morality in France we must go
back, I suspect, to that general conclusion about
the French character&mdash;the swift passage from
head to heart and back again, which, prohibiting
extremes of puritanism and of licence, preserves
a sort of balance.</p>

<p>From this war France will emerge changed,
though less changed very likely than any other
country. A certain self-sufficiency that was very
marked about French life will have sloughed
away. I expect an opening of the doors, a toleration
of other tastes and standards, a softening
of the too narrow definiteness of French
opinion.</p>

<p>Even Paris has opened her heart a little since
the war; and the heart of Paris is close, hard, impatient
of strangers. We noticed in our hospital
that whenever we had a Parisian he introduced a
different atmosphere, and led us a quiet or noisy
dance. We had one whose name was Aimé,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
whose skin was like a baby's, who talked softly
and fast, with little grunts, and before he left was
quite the leading personality. We had another,
a red-haired young one; when he was away on
leave we hardly knew the hospital, it was so
orderly. The sons of Paris are a breed apart,
just as our Cockneys are. I do not pretend to
fathom them; they have the texture and resilience
of an indiarubber ball. And the women of Paris!
Heaven forfend that I should say I know them!
They are a sealed book. Still, even Parisians are
less intolerant than in pre-war days of us dull
English, perceiving in us, perhaps, a certain unexpected
usefulness. And, <i>à propos</i>! One hears
it said that in the regions of our British armies
certain natives believe we have come to stay.
What an intensely comic notion! And what a
lurid light it throws on history, on the mistrust
engendered between nations, on the cynicism
which human conduct has forced deep into human
hearts. No! If a British Government could be
imagined behaving in such a way, the British
population would leave England, become French
citizens, and help to turn out the damned intruders!</p>

<p>But <i>we</i> did not encounter anywhere that comic
belief. In all this land of France, chockful of
those odd creatures, English men and women, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
found only a wonderful and touching welcome.
Not once during those long months of winter was
an unfriendly word spoken in our hearing; not
once were we treated with anything but true
politeness and cordiality. <i>Poilus</i> and peasants,
porters and officials, ladies, doctors, servants,
shop-folk, were always considerate, always
friendly, always desirous that we should feel at
home. The very dogs gave us welcome! A little
black half-Pomeranian came uninvited and
made his home with us in our hospital; we called
him Aristide. But on our walks with him we
were liable to meet a posse of children who would
exclaim, "<i>Pom-pom! Voilà, Pom-pom!</i>" and
lead him away. Before night fell he would be
with us again, with a bit of string or ribbon, bitten
through, dangling from his collar. His children
bored him terribly. We left him in trust to
our <i>poilus</i> on that sad afternoon when "Good-bye"
must be said, all those friendly hands shaken
for the last time, and the friendly faces left.
Through the little town the car bore us, away
along the valley between the poplar trees with
the first flush of spring on their twigs, and the
magpies flighting across the road to the river-bank.</p>

<p>The heart of France is deep within her breast;
she wears it not upon her sleeve. But France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
opened her heart for once and let us see the
gold.</p>

<p>And so we came forth from France of a rainy
day, leaving half our hearts behind us.</p>

<h2>ENGLISHMAN AND RUSSIAN</h2>

<p>It has been my conviction for many years that
the Russian and the Englishman are as it were
the complementary halves of a man. What the
Russian lacks the Englishman has; what the Englishman
lacks, that has the Russian. The works
of Gogol, Turgenev, Dostoievsky, Tolstoi, Tchekov&mdash;the
amazing direct and truthful revelations
of these masters&mdash;has let me, I think, into some
secrets of the Russian soul, so that the Russians
I have met seem rather clearer to me than men
and women of other foreign countries. For their
construing I have been given what schoolboys
call a crib. Only a fool pretends to knowledge&mdash;the
heart of another is surely a dark forest; but
the heart of a Russian seems to me a forest less
dark than many, partly because the qualities and
defects of a Russian impact so sharply on the
perceptions of an Englishman, but partly because
those great Russian novelists in whom I have
delighted, possess, before all other gifts, so deep
a talent for the revelation of truth. In following
out this apposition of the Russian and the Englishman,
one may well start with that little matter
of "truth." The Englishman has what I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
would call a passion for the forms of truth; his
word is his bond&mdash;nearly always; he will not tell
a lie&mdash;not often; honesty, in his idiom, is the best
policy. But he has little or no regard for the
spirit of truth. Quite unconsciously he revels in
self-deception and flies from knowledge of anything
which will injure his intention to "make
good," as Americans say. He is, before all things,
a competitive soul who seeks to win rather than
to understand or to "live." And to win, or,
shall we say, to maintain to oneself the illusion
of winning, one must carefully avoid seeing too
much. The Russian is light hearted about the
forms of truth, but revels in self-knowledge and
frank self-declaration, enjoys unbottoming the
abysses of his thoughts and feelings, however
gloomy. In Russia time and space have no exact
importance, living counts for more than dominating
life, emotion is not castrated, feelings are
openly indulged in; in Russia there are the extremes
of cynicism, and of faith; of intellectual
subtlety, and simplicity; truth has quite another
significance; manners are different; what we know
as "good form" is a meaningless shibboleth.
The Russian rushes at life, drinks the cup to the
dregs, then frankly admits that it has dregs, and
puts up with the disillusionment. The Englishman
holds the cup gingerly and sips, determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
to make it last his time, not to disturb the dregs,
and to die without having reached the bottom.</p>

<p>These are the two poles of that instinctive
intention to get out of life all there is in it&mdash;which
is ever the unconscious philosophy guiding mankind.
To the Russian it is vital to realise at all
costs the fulness of sensation and reach the limits
of comprehension; to the Englishman it is vital
to preserve illusion and go on defeating death
until death so unexpectedly defeats him.</p>

<p>What this wide distinction comes from I know
not, unless from the difference of our climates and
geographical circumstances. Russians are the
children of vast plains and forests, dry air, and
extremes of heat and cold; the English, of the
sea, small, uneven hedge-rowed landscapes, mist,
and mean temperatures. By an ironical paradox,
we English have achieved a real liberty of speech
and action, even now denied to Russians, who
naturally far surpass us in desire to turn things
inside out and see of what they are made. The
political arrangements of a country are based on
temperament; and a political freedom which suits
us, an old people, predisposed to a practical and
cautious view of life, is proving difficult, if not
impossible, for Russians, a young people, who
spend themselves so freely. But what Russia will
become, politically speaking, he would be rash
who prophesied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
I suppose what Russians most notice and perhaps
envy in us is practical common sense, our
acquired instinct for what is attainable, and for
the best and least elaborate means of attaining it.
What we ought to envy in Russians is a sort of
unworldliness&mdash;not the feeling that this world is
the preliminary of another, nothing so commercial;
but the natural disposition to live each moment
without afterthought, emotionally. Lack of
emotional abandonment is our great deficiency.
Whether we can ever learn to have more is very
doubtful. But our imaginative writings, at all
events, have of late been profoundly modified by
the Russian novel, that current in literature far
more potent than any of those traced out in Georg
Brandes' monumental study. Russian writers
have brought to imaginative literature a directness
in the presentation of vision, a lack of self-consciousness,
strange to all Western countries,
and particularly strange to us English, who of all
people are the most self-conscious. This quality
of Russian writers is evidently racial, for even in
the most artful of them&mdash;Turgenev&mdash;it is as apparent
as in the least sophisticated. It is part,
no doubt, of their natural power of flinging themselves
deep into the sea of experience and sensation;
of their self-forgetfulness in a passionate
search for truth.</p>

<p>In such living Russian writers as I have read,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
in Kuprin, Gorky, and others, I still see and welcome
this peculiar quality of rendering life through&mdash;but
not veiled by&mdash;the author's temperament;
so that the effect is almost as if no ink were used.
When one says that the Russian novel has already
profoundly modified our literature, one does not
mean that we have now nearly triumphed over
the need for ink, or that our temperaments have
become Russian; but that some of us have become
infected with the wish to see and record the truth
and obliterate that competitive moralising which
from time immemorial has been the characteristic
bane of English art. In other words, the Russian
passion for understanding has tempered a little
the English passion for winning. What we admire
and look for in Russian literature is its truth and
its profound and comprehending tolerance. I am
credibly informed that what Russians admire and
look for in our literature is its quality of "no
nonsense" and its assertive vigour. In a word,
they are attracted by that in it which is new to
them. I venture to hope that they will not become
infected by us in this matter; that nothing
will dim in their writers spiritual and intellectual
honesty of vision or tinge them with self-consciousness.
It is still for us to borrow from Russian
literary art, and learn, if we can, to sink ourselves
in life and reproduce it without obtrusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
of our points of view, except in that subtle way
which gives to each creative work its essential
individuality. Our boisterousness in art is too
self-conscious to be real, and our restraint is only
a superficial legacy from Puritanism.</p>

<p>Restraint in life and conduct is another matter
altogether. There Russians can learn from us,
who are past-masters in control of our feelings.
In all matters of conduct, indeed, we are, as it
were, much older than the Russians; we were
more like them, one imagines, in the days of
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Either similarity, or great dissimilarity, is generally
needful for mutual liking. Our soldiers
appear to get on very well with Russians. But
only exceptional natures in either country could
expect to <i>understand</i> each other thoroughly. The
two peoples are as the halves of a whole; different
as chalk from cheese; can supplement, intermingle,
but never replace each other. Both in so different
ways are very vital types of mankind, very deep
sunk in their own atmospheres and natures, very
insulated against all that is not Russian, or is not
English; deeply unchangeable and impermeable.
It is almost impossible to de-Anglicise an Englishman;
as difficult to de-Russianise a Russian.</p>

<h2>AMERICAN AND BRITON</h2>

<p>On the mutual understanding of each other by
Britons and Americans the future happiness of
nations depends more than on any other world
cause.</p>

<p>I have never held a whole-hearted brief for the
British character. There is a lot of good in it,
but much which is repellent. It has a kind of deliberate
unattractiveness, setting out on its journey
with the words: "Take me or leave me."
One may respect a person of this sort, but it is
difficult either to know or to like him. I am told
that an American officer said recently to a British
staff officer in a friendly voice: "So we're going to
clean up Brother Boche together!" and the British
staff officer replied "Really!" No wonder
Americans sometimes say: "I've got no use for
those fellows."</p>

<p>The world is consecrate to strangeness and discovery,
and the attitude of mind concreted in
that "Really!" seems unforgivable, till one remembers
that it is manner rather than matter
which divides the hearts of American and Briton.</p>

<p>In a huge, still half-developed country, where
every kind of national type and habit comes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
run a new thread into the rich tapestry of American
life and thought, people must find it almost
impossible to conceive the life of a little old island
where traditions persist generation after generation
without anything to break them up; where
blood remains undoctored by new strains; demeanour
becomes crystallised for lack of contrasts;
and manner gets set like a plaster mask.
The English manner of to-day, of what are called
the classes, is the growth of only a century or so.
There was probably nothing at all like it in the
days of Elizabeth or even of Charles II. The
English manner was still racy when the inhabitants
of Virginia, as we are told, sent over to ask
that there might be despatched to them some
hierarchical assistance for the good of their souls,
and were answered: "D&mdash;&mdash;n your souls, grow
tobacco!" The English manner of to-day could
not even have come into its own when that epitaph
of a lady, quoted somewhere by Gilbert
Murray, was written: "Bland, passionate, and
deeply religious, she was second cousin to the Earl
of Leitrim; of such are the Kingdom of Heaven."
About that gravestone motto was a certain lack
of the self-consciousness which is now the foremost
characteristic of the English manner.</p>

<p>But this British self-consciousness is no mere
fluffy <i>gaucherie</i>, it is our special form of what Germans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
would call "Kultur." Behind every manifestation
of thought or emotion the Briton retains
control of self, and is thinking: "That's all I'll let
them see"; even: "That's all I'll let myself feel."
This stoicism is good in its refusal to be foundered;
bad in that it fosters a narrow outlook;
starves emotion, spontaneity, and frank sympathy;
destroys grace and what one may describe
roughly as the lovable side of personality. The
English hardly ever say just what comes into
their heads. What we call "good form," the unwritten
law which governs certain classes of the
Briton, savours of the dull and glacial; but there
lurks within it a core of virtue. It has grown up
like callous shell round two fine ideals&mdash;suppression
of the ego lest it trample on the corns of other
people, and exaltation of the maxim: "Deeds before
words." Good form, like any other religion,
starts well with some ethical truth, but soon gets
commonised and petrified till we can hardly trace
its origin, and watch with surprise its denial and
contradiction of the root idea.</p>

<p>Without doubt good form had become a kind
of disease in England. A French friend told me
how he witnessed in a Swiss Hotel the meeting
between an Englishwoman and her son, whom
she had not seen for two years; she was greatly
affected&mdash;by the fact that he had not brought a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
dinner-jacket. The best manners are no "manners,"
or at all events no mannerisms; but many
Britons who have even attained to this perfect
purity are yet not free from the paralytic effects
of "good form"; are still self-conscious in the
depths of their souls, and never do or say a thing
without trying not to show what they are feeling.
All this guarantees a certain decency in life; but
in intimate intercourse with people of other
nations who have not this particular cult of suppression,
we English disappoint, and jar, and
often irritate. Nations have their differing forms
of snobbery. At one time the English all wanted
to be second cousins to the Earl of Leitrim, like
that lady bland and passionate. Nowadays it is
not so simple. The Earl of Leitrim has become
etherealised. We no longer care how a fellow is
born so long as he behaves as the Earl of Leitrim
would have, never makes himself conspicuous or
ridiculous, never shows too much what he's really
feeling, never talks of what he's going to do, and
always "plays the game." The cult is centred in
our public schools and universities.</p>

<p>At a very typical and honoured old public
school the writer of this essay passed on the whole
a happy time; but what a curious life, educationally
speaking! We lived rather like young Spartans;
and were not encouraged to think, imagine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
or see anything that we learned in relation to life
at large. It's very difficult to teach boys, because
their chief object in life is not to be taught
anything, but I should say we were crammed,
not taught at all. Living as we did the herd-life
of boys with little or no intrusion from our elders,
and they men who had been brought up in the
same way as ourselves, we were debarred from
any real interest in philosophy, history, art, literature
and music, or any advancing notions in
social life or politics. I speak of the generality,
not of the few black swans among us. We were
reactionaries almost to a boy. I remember one
summer term Gladstone came down to speak to
us, and we repaired to the Speech Room with
white collars and dark hearts, muttering what we
would do to that Grand Old Man if we could
have our way. But he contrived to charm us,
after all, till we cheered him vociferously. In
that queer life we had all sorts of unwritten rules
of suppression. You must turn up your trousers;
must not go out with your umbrella rolled. Your
hat must be worn tilted forward; you must not
walk more than two-a-breast till you reached a
certain form, nor be enthusiastic about anything,
except such a supreme matter as a drive over the
pavilion at cricket, or a run the whole length of
the ground at football. You must not talk about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
yourself or your home people, and for any punishment
you must assume complete indifference.</p>

<p>I dwell on these trivialities because every year
thousands of British boys enter these mills which
grind exceeding small, and because these boys
constitute in after life the great majority of the
official, military, academic, professional, and a
considerable proportion of the business classes of
Great Britain. They become the Englishmen who
say: "Really!" and they are for the most part
the Englishmen who travel and reach America.
The great defence I have always heard put up for
our public schools is that they form character.
As oatmeal is supposed to form bone in the bodies
of Scotsmen, so our public schools are supposed
to form good, sound moral fibre in British boys.
And there is much in this plea. The life does
make boys enduring, self-reliant, good-tempered
and honourable, but it most carefully endeavours
to destroy all original sin of individuality, spontaneity,
and engaging freakishness. It implants,
moreover, in the great majority of those who
have lived it the mental attitude of that swell,
who when asked where he went for his hats, replied:
"Blank's, of course. Is there another fellow's?"</p>

<p>To know all is to excuse all&mdash;to know all about
the bringing-up of English public school boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
makes one excuse much. The atmosphere and
tradition of those places is extraordinarily strong,
and persists through all modern changes. Thirty-seven
years have gone since I was a new boy, but
cross-examining a young nephew who left not
long ago, I found almost precisely the same
features and conditions. The war, which has
changed so much of our social life, will have some,
but no very great, effect on this particular institution.
The boys still go there from the same
kind of homes and preparatory schools and come
under the same kind of masters. And the traditional
unemotionalism, the cult of a dry and
narrow stoicism, is rather fortified than diminished
by the times we live in.</p>

<p>Our universities, on the other hand, are now
mere ghosts of their old selves. At a certain old
college in Oxford, last term, they had only two
English students. In the chapel under the
Joshua Reynolds window, through which the sun
was shining, hung a long "roll of honour," a hundred
names and more. In the college garden an
open-air hospital was ranged under the old city
wall, where we used to climb and go wandering
in the early summer mornings after some all-night
spree. Down on the river the empty college
barges lay void of life. From the top of one of
them an aged custodian broke into words: "Ah!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Oxford'll never be the same again in my time.
Why, who's to teach 'em rowin'? When we do
get undergrads again, who's to teach 'em? All
the old ones gone, killed, wounded and that. No!
Rowin'll never be the same again&mdash;not in my
time." That was <i>the</i> tragedy of the war for him.
Our universities will recover faster than he thinks,
and resume the care of our particular "Kultur,"
and cap the products of our public schools with
the Oxford accent and the Oxford manner.</p>

<p>An acute critic tells me that Americans reading
such deprecatory words as these by an Englishman
about his country's institutions would
say that this is precisely an instance of what an
American means by the Oxford manner. Americans
whose attitude towards their own country is
that of a lover to his lady or a child to its mother,
cannot&mdash;he says&mdash;understand how Englishmen
can be critical of their own country, and yet love
her. Well, the Englishman's attitude to his
country is that of a man to himself, and the way
he runs her down is but a part of that special
English bone-deep self-consciousness. Englishmen
(the writer amongst them) love their country
as much as the French love France and the
Americans America; but she is so much a part of
them that to speak well of her is like speaking
well of themselves, which they have been brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
up to regard as "bad form." When Americans
hear Englishmen speaking critically of their own
country, let them note it for a sign of complete
identification with that country rather than of
detachment from it. But on the whole it must
be admitted that English universities have a
broadening influence on the material which comes
to them so set and narrow. They do a little to
discover for their children that there are many
points of view, and much which needs an open
mind in this world. They have not precisely a
democratic influence, but taken by themselves
they would not be inimical to democracy. And
when the war is over they will surely be still
broader in philosophy and teaching. Heaven
forbid that we should see vanish all that is old,
and has, as it were, the virginia-creeper, the wistaria
bloom of age upon it; there is a beauty in
age and a health in tradition, ill dispensed with.
What is hateful in age is its lack of understanding
and of sympathy; in a word&mdash;its intolerance.
Let us hope this wind of change may sweep out
and sweeten the old places of our country, sweep
away the cobwebs and the dust, our narrow ways
of thought, our mannikinisms. But those who
hate intolerance dare not be intolerant with the
foibles of age; we should rather see them as comic,
and gently laugh them out. I pretend to no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
proper knowledge of the American people; but,
though amongst them there are doubtless pockets
of fierce prejudice, I have on the whole the impression
of a wide and tolerant spirit. To that
spirit one would appeal when it comes to passing
judgment on the educated Briton. He may be
self-sufficient, but he has grit; and at bottom grit
is what Americans appreciate more than anything.
If the motto of the old Oxford college, "Manners
makyth man," were true, one would often be
sorry for the Briton. But his manners do not
make him; they mar him. His goods are all
absent from the shop window; he is not a man of
the world in the wider meaning of that expression.
And there is, of course, a particularly noxious
type of travelling Briton, who does his best, unconsciously,
to deflower his country wherever he
goes. Selfish, coarse-fibred, loud-voiced&mdash;the sort
which thanks God he is a Briton&mdash;I suppose because
nobody else will do it for him.</p>

<p>We live in times when patriotism is exalted
above all other virtues, because there happen to
lie before the patriotic tremendous chances for
the display of courage and self-sacrifice. Patriotism
ever has that advantage, as the world is
now constituted; but patriotism and provincialism
are sisters under the skin, and they who can
only see bloom on the plumage of their own kind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
who prefer the bad points of their countrymen to
the good points of foreigners, merely write themselves
down blind of an eye, and panderers to
herd feeling. America is advantaged in this
matter. She lives so far away from other nations
that she might well be excused for thinking herself
the only people in the world; but in the many
strains of blood which go to make up America
there is as yet a natural corrective to the narrower
kind of patriotism. America has vast
spaces and many varieties of type and climate,
and life to her is still a great adventure. Americans
have their own form of self-absorption, but
seem free as yet from the special competitive
self-centrement which has been forced on Britons
through long centuries by countless continental
rivalries and wars. Insularity was driven into
the very bones of our people by the generation-long
wars of Napoleon. A distinguished French
writer, André Chevrillon, whose book<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> may be
commended to any one who wishes to understand
British peculiarities, used these words in a recent
letter: "You English are so strange to us French,
you are so utterly different from any other people
in the world." Yes! We are a lonely race.
Deep in our hearts, I think, we feel that only the
American people could ever really understand us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
And being extraordinarily self-conscious, perverse,
and proud, we do our best to hide from
Americans that we have any such feeling. It
would distress the average Briton to confess that
he wanted to be understood, had anything so
natural as a craving for fellowship or for being
liked. We are a weird people, though we seem
so commonplace. In looking at photographs of
British types among photographs of other European
nationalities, one is struck by something
which is in no other of those races&mdash;exactly as if
we had an extra skin; as if the British animal
had been tamed longer than the rest. And so he
has. His political, social, legal life was fixed long
before that of any other Western country. He
was old, though not mouldering, before the <i>Mayflower</i>
touched American shores and brought there
avatars, grave and civilised as ever founded nation.
There is something touching and terrifying
about our character, about the depth at which
it keeps its real yearnings, about the perversity
with which it disguises them, and its inability to
show its feelings. We are, deep down, under all
our lazy mentality, the most combative and competitive
race in the world, with the exception,
perhaps, of the American. This is at once a
spiritual link with America, and yet one of the
great barriers to friendship between the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
peoples. We are not sure whether we are better
men than Americans. Whether we are really better
than French, Germans, Russians, Italians,
Chinese, or any other race is, of course, more
than a question; but those peoples are all so different
from us that we are bound, I suppose,
secretly to consider ourselves superior. But between
Americans and ourselves, under all differences,
there is some mysterious deep kinship
which causes us to doubt and makes us irritable,
as if we were continually being tickled by that
question: Now am I really a better man than he?
Exactly what proportion of American blood at
this time of day is British, I know not; but enough
to make us definitely cousins&mdash;always an awkward
relationship. We see in Americans a sort
of image of ourselves; feel near enough, yet far
enough, to criticise and carp at the points of
difference. It is as though a man went out and
encountered, in the street, what he thought for
the moment was himself, and, wounded in his
<i>amour propre</i>, instantly began to disparage the
appearance of that fellow. Probably community
of language rather than of blood accounts for our
sense of kinship, for a common means of expression
cannot but mould thought and feeling into
some kind of unity. One can hardly overrate
the intimacy which a common literature brings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
The lives of great Americans, Washington and
Franklin, Lincoln and Lee and Grant, are unsealed
for us, just as to Americans are the lives of
Marlborough and Nelson, Pitt and Gladstone
and Gordon. Longfellow and Whittier and Whitman
can be read by the British child as simply
as Burns and Shelley and Keats. Emerson and
William James are no more difficult to us than
Darwin and Spencer to Americans. Without an
effort we rejoice in Hawthorne and Mark Twain,
Henry James and Howells, as Americans can in
Dickens and Thackeray, Meredith and Thomas
Hardy. And, more than all, Americans own with
ourselves all literature in the English tongue
before the <i>Mayflower</i> sailed; Chaucer and Spenser
and Shakespeare, Raleigh, Ben Jonson, and the
authors of the English Bible Version are their
spiritual ancestors as much as ever they are ours.
The tie of language is all-powerful&mdash;for language
is the food formative of minds. A volume could
be written on the formation of character by literary
humour alone. The American and Briton,
especially the British townsman, have a kind of
bone-deep defiance of Fate, a readiness for anything
which may turn up, a dry, wry smile under
the blackest sky, and an individual way of looking
at things which nothing can shake. Americans
and Britons both, we must and will think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
for ourselves, and know why we do a thing before
we do it. We have that ingrained respect for the
individual conscience which is at the bottom of
all free institutions. Some years before the war
an intelligent and cultivated Austrian, who had
lived long in England, was asked for his opinion
of the British. "In many ways," he said, "I
think you are inferior to us; but one great thing I
have noticed about you which we have not.
You think and act and speak for yourselves." If
he had passed those years in America instead of
in England he must needs have pronounced the
same judgment of Americans. Free speech, of
course, like every form of freedom, goes in danger
of its life in war-time. The other day, in
Russia, an Englishman came on a street meeting
shortly after the first revolution had begun. An
extremist was addressing the gathering and telling
them that they were fools to go on fighting,
that they ought to refuse and go home, and so
forth. The crowd grew angry, and some soldiers
were for making a rush at him; but the chairman,
a big, burly peasant, stopped them with these
words: "Brothers, you know that our country is
now a country of free speech. We must listen
to this man, we must let him say anything he
will. But, brothers, when he's finished, we'll
bash his head in!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
I cannot assert that either Britons or Americans
are incapable in times like these of a similar
interpretation of "free speech." Things have
been done in our country, and will be done in
America, which should make us blush. But so
strong is the free instinct in both countries that
some vestiges of it will survive even this war, for
democracy is a sham unless it means the preservation
and development of this instinct of thinking
for oneself throughout a people. "Government
of the people by the people for the people"
means nothing unless individuals keep their
consciences unfettered and think freely. Accustom
people to be nose-led and spoon-fed, and
democracy is a mere pretence. The measure of
democracy is the measure of the freedom and
sense of individual responsibility in its humblest
citizens. And democracy&mdash;I say it with solemnity&mdash;has
yet to prove itself.</p>

<p>A scientist, Dr. Spurrell, in a recent book,
"Man and his Forerunners," diagnoses the growth
of civilisations somewhat as follows: A civilisation
begins with the enslavement by some hardy race
of a tame race living a tame life in more congenial
natural surroundings. It is built up on slavery,
and attains its maximum vitality in conditions
little removed therefrom. Then, as individual
freedom gradually grows, disorganisation sets in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
and the civilisation slowly dissolves away in
anarchy. Dr. Spurrell does not dogmatise about
our present civilisation, but suggests that it will
probably follow the civilisations of the past into
dissolution. I am not convinced of that, because
of certain factors new to the history of man.
Recent discoveries are unifying the world; such
old isolated swoops of race on race are not now
possible. In our great industrial States, it is
true, a new form of slavery has arisen, but not
of man by man, rather of man by machines.
Moreover, all past civilisations have been more
or less Southern, and subject to the sapping influence
of the sun. Modern civilisation is essentially
Northern. The individualism, however,
which, according to Dr. Spurrell, dissolved the
Empires of the past, exists already, in a marked
degree, in every modern State; and the problem
before us is to discover how democracy and liberty
of the subject can be made into enduring props
rather than dissolvents. It is the problem of
making democracy genuine. And certainly, if
that cannot be achieved and perpetuated, there is
nothing to prevent democracy drifting into anarchism
and dissolving modern States, till they are
the prey of pouncing dictators, or of States not
so far gone in dissolution. What, for instance,
will happen to Russia if she does not succeed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
making her democracy genuine? A Russia which
remains anarchic must very quickly become the
prey of her neighbours on West and East.</p>

<p>Ever since the substantial introduction of democracy
nearly a century and a half ago with
the American War of Independence, Western civilisation
has been living on two planes or levels&mdash;the
autocratic plane, with which is bound up the
idea of nationalism, and the democratic, to which
has become conjoined the idea of internationalism.
Not only little wars, but great wars such as this,
come because of inequality in growth, dissimilarity
of political institutions between States; because
this State or that is basing its life on different
principles from its neighbours. The decentralisation,
delays, critical temper, and importance of
home affairs prevalent in democratic countries
make them at once slower, weaker, less apt to
strike, and less prepared to strike than countries
where bureaucratic brains subject to no real
popular check devise world policies which can be
thrust, prepared to the last button, on the world
at a moment's notice. The free and critical
spirit in America, France, and Britain has kept
our democracies comparatively unprepared for
anything save their own affairs.</p>

<p>We fall into glib usage of words like democracy
and make fetiches of them without due understanding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
Democracy is inferior to autocracy
from the aggressively national point of view; it
is not necessarily superior to autocracy as a guarantee
of general well-being; it may even turn out
to be inferior unless we can improve it. But
democracy is the rising tide; it may be dammed
or delayed, but cannot be stopped. It seems to
be a law in human nature that where, in any
corporate society, the idea of self-government sets
foot it refuses to take that foot up again. State
after State, copying the American example, has
adopted the democratic principle; the world's face
is that way set. And civilisation is now so of a
pattern that the Western world may be looked on
as one State and the process of change therein
from autocracy to democracy regarded as though
it were taking place in a single old-time country
such as Greece or Rome. If throughout Western
civilisation we can secure the single democratic
principle of government, its single level of State
morality in thought and action, we shall be well
on our way to unanimity throughout the world;
for even in China and Japan the democratic virus
is at work. It is my belief that only in a world
thus uniform, and freed from the danger of pounce
by autocracies, have States any chance to develop
the individual conscience to a point which shall
make democracy proof against anarchy and themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
proof against dissolution; and only in such
a world can a League of Nations to enforce peace
succeed.</p>

<p>But even if we do secure a single plane for
Western civilisation and ultimately for the world,
there will be but slow and difficult progress in the
lot of mankind. And unless we secure it, there
will be only a march backwards.</p>

<p>For this advance to a uniform civilisation the
solidarity of the English-speaking races is vital.
Without that there will be no bottom on which
to build.</p>

<p>The ancestors of the American people sought a
new country because they had in them a reverence
for the individual conscience; they came
from Britain, the first large State in the Christian
era to build up the idea of political freedom. The
instincts and ideals of our two races have ever
been the same. That great and lovable people,
the French, with their clear thought and expression,
and their quick blood, have expressed those
ideals more vividly than either of us. But the
phlegmatic and the dry tenacity of our English
and American temperaments has ever made our
countries the most settled and safe homes of the
individual conscience, and of its children&mdash;Democracy,
Freedom and Internationalism. Whatever
their faults&mdash;and their offences cry aloud to such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
poor heaven as remains of chivalry and mercy&mdash;the
Germans are in many ways a great race, but
they possess two qualities dangerous to the individual
conscience&mdash;unquestioning obedience and
exaltation. When they embrace the democratic
idea they may surpass us all in its logical development,
but the individual conscience will still not
be at ease with them. We must look to our two
countries to guarantee its strength and activity,
and if we English-speaking races quarrel and become
disunited, civilisation will split up again
and go its way to ruin. We are the ballast of
the new order.</p>

<p>I do not believe in formal alliances or in grouping
nations to exclude and keep down other nations.
Friendships between countries should have
the only true reality of common sentiment, <i>and
be animated by desire for the general welfare of
mankind</i>. We need no formal bonds, but we
have a sacred charge in common, to let no petty
matters, differences of manner, or divergencies of
material interest, destroy our spiritual agreement.
Our pasts, our geographical positions, our temperaments
make us, beyond all other races, the
hope and trustees of mankind's advance along
the only line now open&mdash;democratic internationalism.
It is childish to claim for Americans or
Britons virtues beyond those of other nations, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
to believe in the superiority of one national culture
to another; they are different, that is all.
It is by accident that we find ourselves in this
position of guardianship to the main line of human
development; no need to pat ourselves on the
back about it. But we are at a great and critical
moment in the world's history&mdash;how critical
none of us alive will ever realise. The civilisation
slowly built since the fall of Rome has either to
break up and dissolve into jagged and isolated
fragments through a century of wars; or, unified
and reanimated by a single idea, to move forward
on one plane and attain greater height and breadth.</p>

<p>Under the pressure of this war there is, beneath
the lip-service we pay to democracy, a disposition
to lose faith in it because of its undoubted weakness
and inconvenience in a struggle with States
autocratically governed; there is even a sort of
secret reaction to autocracy. On those lines there
is no way out of a future of bitter rivalries, chicanery
and wars, and the probable total failure
of our civilisation. The only cure which I can
see lies in democratising the whole world and
removing the present weaknesses and shams of
democracy by education of the individual conscience
in every country. Good-bye to that
chance if Americans and Britons fall foul of each
other, refuse to pool their thoughts and hopes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
and to keep the general welfare of mankind in
view. They have got to stand together, not in
aggressive and jealous policies, but in defence and
championship of the self-helpful, self-governing,
"live and let live" philosophy of life.</p>

<p>The house of the future is always dark. There
are few corner-stones to be discerned in the temple
of our fate. But of these few one is the
brotherhood and bond of the English-speaking
races, not for narrow purposes, but that mankind
may yet see faith and good-will enshrined,
yet breathe a sweeter air, and know a life where
Beauty passes, with the sun on her wings.</p>

<p>We want in the lives of men a "Song of Honour,"
as in Ralph Hodgson's poem:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The song of men all sorts and kinds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As many tempers, moods and minds<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As leaves are on a tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As many faiths and castes and creeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As many human bloods and breeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As in the world may be."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the making of that song the English-speaking
races will assuredly unite. What made this
world we know not; the principle of life is inscrutable
and will for ever be; but we know that Earth
is yet on the up-grade of existence, the mountain-top
of man's life not reached, that many centuries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
of growth are yet in front of us before Nature
begins to chill this planet till it swims, at last,
another moon, in space. In the climb to that
mountain-top of a happy life for mankind our
two great nations are as guides who go before,
roped together in perilous ascent. On their
nerve, loyalty, and wisdom the adventure now
hangs. What American or British knife will
sever the rope?</p>

<p>He who ever gives a thought to the life of man
at large, to his miseries and disappointments, to
the waste and cruelty of existence, will remember
that if American or Briton fail himself, or fail the
other, there can but be for us both, and for all
other peoples, a hideous slip, a swift and fearful
fall into an abyss, whence all shall be to begin
over again.</p>

<p>We shall not fail&mdash;neither ourselves, nor each
other. Our comradeship will endure.</p>

<h2>ANGLO-AMERICAN DRAMA AND ITS<br />
FUTURE<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></h2>

<p>There is a maxim particularly suitable to those
who follow any art: "Don't talk about what you
do!" And yet, once in a way, one must clear the
mind and put into words what lies at the back
of endeavour.</p>

<p>What, then, is lying at the back of any growth
or development there may have been of late in
drama?</p>

<p>In my belief, simply an outcrop of sincerity&mdash;of
fidelity to mood, to impression, to self. A
man here and there has turned up who has
imagined something true to what he has really
seen and felt, and has projected it across the foot-lights
in such a way as to make other people feel
it. This is all that has happened lately on our
stage. And if it be growth, it will not be growth
in quantity, since there is nothing like sincerity
for closing the doors of theatres. For, just consider
what sincerity excludes: All care for balance
at the author's bank&mdash;even when there is no balance;
all habit of consulting the expression on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the public's face; all confectioning of French
plays; all the convenient practice of adding up
your plots on the principle that two and two
make five. These it excludes. It includes: Nothing
because it pays; nothing because it will make
a sensation; no situations faked; no characters
falsified; no fireworks; only something imagined
and put down in a passion of sincerity. What
plays, you may say, are left? Well, that was
the development in our drama before this war
began. The war arrested it, as it arrested every
movement of the day in civil life. But whether
in war or peace, the principles which underlie art
remain the same and are always worth consideration.</p>

<p>Sincerity in the theatre and commercial success
are not necessarily, but they are generally, opposed.
It is more or less a happy accident when,
they coincide. This grim truth cannot be blinked.
Not till the heavens fall will the majority of the
public demand sincerity. And all that they who
care for sincerity can hope for is that the supply
of sincere drama will gradually increase the demand
for it&mdash;gradually lessen the majority which
has no use for that disturbing quality. The burden
of this struggle is on the shoulders of the
dramatists. It is useless and unworthy for them
to complain that the public will not stand sincerity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
that they cannot get sincere plays acted,
and so forth. If they have not the backbone to
produce what they feel they ought to produce,
without regard to what the public wants, then
good-bye to progress of any kind. If they are of
the crew who cannot see any good in a fight unless
they know it is going to end in victory; if
they expect the millennium with every spring&mdash;they
will advance nothing. Their job is to set
their teeth, do their work in their own way, without
thinking much about result, and not at all
about reward, except from their own consciences.
Those who want sincerity will always be the few,
but they may well be more numerous than now;
and to increase their number is worth a struggle.
That struggle was the much-sneered-at, much-talked-of
so-called "new" movement in our British
drama.</p>

<p>Now it was the fashion to dub this new drama
the "serious" drama; the label was unfortunate,
and not particularly true. If Rabelais or Robert
Burns appeared again in mortal form and took
to writing plays, they would be "new" dramatists
with a vengeance&mdash;as new as ever Ibsen was, and
assuredly they would be sincere. But could they
well be called "serious"? Can we call Synge,
or St. John Hankin, or Shaw, or Barrie serious?
Hardly! Yet they are all of this new movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
in their very different ways, because they are
sincere. The word "serious," in fact, has too
narrow a significance and admits a deal of pompous stuff
which is not sincere. While the word
"sincere" certainly does not characterise all that
is popularly included under the term "new
drama," it as certainly does characterise (if taken
in its true sense of fidelity to self) all that is really
new in it, and excludes no mood, no temperament,
no form of expression which can pass the test of
ringing true. Look, for example, at the work of
those two whom we could so ill spare&mdash;Synge
and St. John Hankin. They were as far apart as
dramatists well could be, except that each had
found a special medium&mdash;the one a kind of lyric
satire, the other a neat, individual sort of comedy&mdash;which
seemed exactly to express his spirit.
Both forms were in a sense artificial, but both
were quite sincere; for through them each of
these two dramatists, so utterly dissimilar, shaped
forth the essence of his broodings and visions of
life, with all their flavour and individual limitations.
And that is all one means by&mdash;all one
asks of&mdash;sincerity.</p>

<p>Then why make such a fuss about it?</p>

<p>Because it is rare, and an implicit quality of
any true work of art, realistic or romantic.</p>

<p>Art is not art unless it is made out of an artist's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
genuine feeling and vision, not out of what he has
been told he ought to feel and see. For art exists
not to confirm people in their tastes and prejudices,
not to show them what they have seen
before, but to present them with a new vision of
life. And if drama be an art (which the great
public denies daily, but a few of us still believe),
it must reasonably be expected to present life as
each dramatist sees it, and not to express things
because they pander to popular prejudice, or are
sensational, or because they pay.</p>

<p>If you want further evidence that the new dramatic
movement is marked out by its struggle
for sincerity, and by that alone, examine a little
the various half-overt oppositions with which it
meets.</p>

<p>Why is the commercial manager against it?</p>

<p>Because it is quite naturally his business to
cater for the great public; and, as before said, the
majority of the public does not, never will, want
sincerity; it is too disturbing. The commercial
manager will answer: "The great public does not
dislike sincerity, it only dislikes dullness." Well!
Dullness is not an absolute, but a very relative
term&mdash;a term likely to have a different meaning
for a man who knows something about life and
art from that which it has for a man who knows
less. And one may remark that if the great public's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
standard of what is really "amusing" is the
true one, it is queer that the plays which tickle
the great public hardly ever last a decade, while
the plays which do not tickle them occasionally
last for centuries. The "dullest" plays, one
might say roughly, are those which last the longest.
Witness Euripides!</p>

<p>Why are so many actor-managers against the
new drama?</p>

<p>Because their hearts are quite naturally set on
such insincere distortions of values as are necessary
to a constant succession of "big parts" for
themselves. Sincerity does not necessarily exclude
heroic characters, but it does exclude those
mock heroics which actor-managers have been
known to prefer&mdash;not to real heroics, perhaps,
but to simple and sound studies of character.</p>

<p>Why is the Censorship against it?</p>

<p>Because censorship is quite naturally the guardian
of the ordinary prejudices of sentiment and
taste, and quaintly innocent of knowledge that
in any art fidelity of treatment is essential to a
theme. Indeed, I am sure that this peculiar
office would regard it as fantastic for a poor devil
of an artist to want to be faithful or sincere. The
demand would appear pedantic and extravagant.</p>

<p>Some say that the critics are against the new
drama. That is not in the main true. The inclination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
of most critics is to welcome anything
with a flavour of its own; it would be odd indeed
if it were not so&mdash;they get so much of the other
food! They are, in general, friends to sincerity.
But the trouble with the critic is rather the fixed
idea. He has to print his opinion of an author's
work, while other men have only to think it; and
when it comes to receiving a fresh impression of
the same author, his already recorded words are
liable to act on him rather as the eyes of a snake
act on a rabbit. Indeed, it must be very awkward,
when you have definitely labelled an
author this, or that, to find from his next piece of
work that he is the other as well! The critic who
can make blank his soul of all that he has said
before may indeed exist&mdash;in Paradise!</p>

<p>Why is the greater public against the new
drama?</p>

<p>By the greater public I in no sense mean the
public who don't keep motor cars&mdash;the greater
public comes from the West-end as much as ever
it comes from the East-end. Its opposition to
the "new drama" is neither covert, doubtful, nor
conscious of itself. The greater public is like an
aged friend of mine, who, if you put into his
hands anything but Sherlock Holmes, or The
Waverley Novels, says: "Oh! that dreadful
book!" His taste is excellent, only he does feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
that an operation should be performed on all
dramatists and novelists by which they should
be rendered incapable of producing anything but
what my aged friend is used to. The greater
public, in fact, is either a too well-dined organism
which wishes to digest its dinner, or a too hard-worked
organism longing for a pleasant dream. I
sympathise with the greater public!...</p>

<p>A friend once said to me: "Champagne has
killed the drama." It was half a truth. Champagne
is an excellent thing, and must not be disturbed.
Plays should not have anything in them
which can excite the mind. They should be of a
quality to just remove the fumes by eleven o'clock
and make ready the organism for those suppers
which were eaten before the war. Another friend
once said to me: "It is the rush and hurry and
strenuousness of modern life which is scotching
the drama." Again, it was half a truth. Why
should not the hard-worked man have his pleasant
dream, his detective story, his good laugh?
The pity is that sincere drama would often provide
as agreeable dreams for the hard-worked
man as some of those reveries in which he now
indulges, if only he would try it once or twice.
That is the trouble&mdash;to get him to give it a chance.</p>

<p>The greater public will by preference take the
lowest article in art offered to it. An awkward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
remark, and unfortunately true. But if a better
article be substituted, the greater public very
soon enjoys it every bit as much as the article
replaced, and so on&mdash;up to a point which we need
not fear we shall ever reach. Not that sincere
dramatists are consciously trying to supply the
public with a better article. A man could not
write anything sincere with the elevation of the
public as incentive. If he tried, he would be as
lost as ever were the Pharisees making broad their
phylacteries. He can only express himself sincerely
<i>by not considering the public at all</i>. People
often say that this is "cant," but it really isn't.
There does exist a type of mind which cannot express
itself in accordance with what it imagines is
required; can only express itself for itself, and
take the usually unpleasant consequences. This
is, indeed, but an elementary truth, which since
the beginning of the world has lain at the bottom
of all real artistic achievement. It is not cant to
say that the only things vital in drama, as in
every art, are achieved when the maker has fixed
his soul on the making of a thing which shall seem
fine to himself. It is the only standard; all the
others&mdash;success, money, even the pleasure and
benefit of other people&mdash;lead to confusion in the
artist's spirit, and to the making of dust castles.
To please your best self is the only way of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
sincere. Most weavers of drama, of course, are
perfectly sincere when they start out to ply their
shuttles; but how many persevere in that mood
to the end of their plays, in defiance of outside
consideration? Here&mdash;says one to himself&mdash;it
will be too strong meat; there it will not be sufficiently
convincing; this natural length will be too
short, that end too appalling; in such and such a
shape I shall never get my play taken; I must
write that part up and tone this character down.
And when it is all done, effectively, falsely&mdash;what
is there? A prodigious run, perhaps. But&mdash;the
grave of all which makes the life of an artist worth
the living. Well! well! We who believe this
will never get too many others to believe it!
Those heavens will not fall; theatre doors will
remain open; the heavy diners will digest, and the
over-driven man will dream. And yet, with each
sincere thing made&mdash;even if only fit for reposing
within a drawer&mdash;its maker is stronger, and will
some day, perhaps, make that which need not
lie covered away, but reach out from him to other
men.</p>

<p>It is a wide word&mdash;sincerity. "A Midsummer
Night's Dream" is no less sincere than "Hamlet,"
"The Mikado" as faithful to its mood of satiric
frolicking as Ibsen's "Ghosts" to its mood of
moral horror. Sincerity bars out no themes; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
only demands that the dramatist's moods and
visions should be intense enough to keep him
absorbed; that he should have something to say
so engrossing to himself that he has no need to
stray here and there and gather purple plums to
eke out what was intended to be an apple tart.
Here is the heart of the matter: You cannot get
sincere drama out of those who do not see and
feel with sufficient fervour; and you cannot get
good sincere drama out of those who will not hoe
their rows to the very end. There is no faking
and no scamping to the good in art. You may
turn out the machine-made article very natty,
but for the real hand-made thing you must have
toiled in the sweat of your brow. In Britain it is
a little difficult to persuade people that the writing
of plays and novels is work. To many it
remains one of those inventions of a certain potentate
for idle hands to do. To some persons in
high life, and addicted to field sports, it is still a
species of licensed buffoonery, to be regulated by
a sort of circus-master with a whip in one hand
and a gingerbread nut in the other. By the truly
simple soul it is thus summed up: "Work! Why,
'e sits writin' all day." To some, both green and
young, it shines as a vocation entirely glorious
and exhilarating. If one may humbly believe the
evidence of his own senses, it is not any of these,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
but a patient calling, glamorous now and then,
but with fifty minutes of hard labour and yearning
to every ten of satisfaction. Not a pursuit,
maybe, which one would change, but then, what
man with a profession flies to others that he knows
not of?</p>

<p>Novelists, it is true, even if they have not been
taken too seriously by the people of these islands,
have for a long time past respected themselves,
but the calling of a dramatist till quite of late has
been but an invertebrate and spiritless concern.
Pruned and prismed by the censor, exploited by
the actor, dragooned and slashed by the manager,
ignored by the public, who never even bothered
to inquire the names of those who supplied it
with digestives&mdash;it was a slave's job. Thanks to
a little sincerity it is not now a slave's job, and
will not again, I think, become one.</p>

<p>From time to time in that vehicle of improvisation,
that modern fairy tale&mdash;our daily paper&mdash;we
read words such as these: "What has become
of the boasted renascence of our stage?" or: "So
much for all the trumpeting about the new
drama!" When we come across such words, we
remember that it is only natural for journals to
say to-day the opposite of what they said yesterday.
For they have to suit all tastes and preserve
a decent equilibrium!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
There is a new safeguard of the self-respecting
dramatist which no amount of improvising for or
against will explain away. Plays are now not
merely acted, they are published and read, and
will be read more and more. This does not mean,
as some say, that they are being written for the
study&mdash;they were never being written more deliberately,
more carefully, for the stage. It does
mean that they are tending more and more to
comply with fidelity to theme, fidelity to self; and
therefore are more and more able to bear the
scrutiny of cold daylight. And for the first time,
perhaps, since the days of Shakespeare there are
dramatists in this country, not a few, faithful to
themselves.</p>

<p>Now, all this is not merely fortuitous. For,
however abhorrent such a notion may be to those
yet wedded to Victorian ideals, we were, even
before the war, undoubtedly passing through great
changes in our philosophy of life. Just as a plant
keeps on conforming to its environment, so our
beliefs and ideals are conforming to our new
social conditions and discoveries. There is in the
air a revolt against prejudice, and a feeling that
things must be re-tested. The spirit which, dwelling
in pleasant places, would never re-test anything
is now looked on askance. Even on our
stage we are not enamoured of it. It is not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
artist's business (be he dramatist or other) to
preach. Admitted! His business is to portray;
but portray truly he cannot if he has any of that
glib doctrinaire spirit, devoid of the insight which
comes from instinctive sympathy. He must look
at <i>life</i>, not at a mirage of life compounded of
authority, tradition, comfort, habit. The sincere
artist, by the very nature of him, is bound to be
curious and perceptive, with an instinctive craving
to identify himself with the experience of
others. This is his value, whether he express it
in comedy, epic, satire, or tragedy. Sincerity
distrusts tradition, authority, comfort, habit; cannot
breathe the air of prejudice, and cannot stand
the cruelties which arise from it. So it comes
about that the new drama's spirit is essentially,
inevitably human and&mdash;humane, essentially distasteful
to many professing followers of the Great
Humanitarian, who, if they were but sincere,
would see that they secretly abhor His teachings
and in practice continually invert them.</p>

<p>It is a fine age we live in&mdash;this age of a developing
social conscience, and worthy of a fine and
great art. But, though no art is fine unless it
has sincerity, no amount of sincere intention will
serve unless the expression of it be well-nigh perfect.
An author is judged, not by intention but
by achievement; and criticism is innately inclined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
to remark first on the peccadillo points of a person,
a poem, or a play. If there be a scar on the
forehead, a few false quantities, or weak endings,
if there is an absence in the third act of some one
who appeared in the first&mdash;it is always much simpler
to complain of this than to feel or describe
the essence of the whole. But this very pettiness
in our criticism is, fortunately, a sort of safeguard.
The French writer Buffon said: "<i>Bien
écrire, c'est tout; car bien écrire c'est bien sentir,
bien penser, et bien dire.</i>" ... Let the artist
then, by all means, make his work impeccable,
clothe his ideas, feelings, visions, in just such garments
as can withstand the winds of criticism.
He himself must be his cruellest critic. Before
cutting his cloth let him very carefully determine
the precise thickness, shape, and colour best suited
to the condition of his temperature. For there are
still playwrights who, working in the full blast of
an <i>affaire</i> between a poet and the wife of a stockbroker,
will murmur to themselves: "Now for
a little lyricism!" and drop into it. Or when
the strong, silent stockbroker has brought his wife
once more to heel: "Now for the moral!" and
gives it us. Or when things are getting a little
too intense: "Now for humour and variety!" and
bring in the curate. This kind of tartan kilt is
very pleasant on its native heath of London; but&mdash;hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
the garment of good writing. Good writing
is only the perfect clothing of mood&mdash;the just
right form. Shakespeare's form, you will say, was
extraordinarily loose, wide, plastic; but then his
spirit was ever changing its mood&mdash;a true chameleon.
And as to the form of Mr. Shaw&mdash;who was
once compared with Shakespeare&mdash;why! there is
none. And yet, what form could so perfectly express
Mr. Shaw's glorious crusade against stupidity,
his wonderfully sincere and lifelong mood of
sticking pins into a pig!</p>

<p>We are told, <i>ad nauseam</i>, that the stage has
laws of its own, to which all dramatists must
bow. Quite true! The stage <i>has</i> the highly
technical laws of its physical conditions, which
cannot be neglected. But even when they are all
properly attended to, it is only behind the elbow
of one who feels strongly and tries to express sincerely
that right expression stands. The imaginative
mood, coming who knows when, staying
none too long, is a mistress who deserves, and
certainly expects, fidelity. True to her while she
is there, do not, when she is not there, insult her
by looking in every face and thinking it will serve!
These are laws of sincerity which not even a past-master
in the laws of the stage can afford to neglect.
Anything is better than resorting to moral
sentiments and solutions because they are current<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
coin, or to decoration because it is "the
thing." And&mdash;as to humour: though nothing is
more precious than the genuine topsy-turvy feeling,
nothing is more pitifully unhumorous than
the dragged-in epigram or dismal knockabout,
which has no connection with the persons or
philosophy of the play.</p>

<p>I suppose it is easy to think oneself sincere; it
is certainly difficult to be that same. Imagine
the smile, and the blue pencil, of the Spirit of
Sincerity if we could appoint him Censor. I
would not lift my pen against that Censorship
though he excised&mdash;as perhaps he might&mdash;the
half of my work. Sometimes one has a glimpse
of his ironic face and his swift fingers, busy with
those darkening pages. Once I dreamed about
him. It was while a certain Commission was sitting
on the British Censorship, which still so admirably
guards Insincerity, and he was giving
evidence before them. This, I remember, was
what he said:</p>

<p>"You wish to learn of me what is sincerity?
Look into yourselves, for what lies deepest within
you. Each living thing varies from every other
living thing, and never twice are there quite the
same set of premises from which to draw conclusion.
Give up asking of any but yourselves for
the whereabouts of truth; and if some one says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
that he can tell you where it is, don't believe him;
he might as well lay a trail of sand and think it
will stay there for ever." He stopped, and I
could see him looking to judge what impression
he had made upon the Commission. But those
gentlemen behaved as if they had not heard him.
The Spirit of Sincerity coughed. "By Jove, gentlemen,"
he said, "it's clear you don't care what
impression you make on me. Evidently it is for
me to learn sincerity from you!"</p>

<p>There was once a gentleman, lately appointed
to assist in the control of the exuberance of plays,
who stated in public print that there had been
no plays of any value written since 1885, entirely
denying that this new drama was any better than
the old drama, cut to the pattern of Scribe and
Sardou. Certainly, novelty is not necessarily improvement.
Comparison must be left to history.
But it is just as well to remember that we
are not born connoisseurs of plays. Without
trying the new we shall not know if it is better
than the old. To appreciate even drama at its
true value, a man must be educated just a little.
When I first went to the National Gallery in London
I was struck dumb with love of Landseer's
stags and a Greuze damsel with her cheek glued
to her own shoulder, and became voluble from
admiration of the large Turner and the large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Claude hung together in that perpetual prize-fight!
At a second visit I discovered Sir Joshua's
"Countess of Albemarle" and old Crome's
"Mousehold Heath," and did not care quite so
much for Landseer's stags. And again and again
I went, and each time saw a little differently, a
little clearer, until at last my time was spent
before Titian's "Bacchus and Ariadne," Botticelli's
"Portrait of a Young Man," the Francescas,
Da Messina's little "Crucifixion," the Uccello
battle picture (that great test of education), the
Velasquez (?) "Admiral," Hogarth's "Five Servants,"
and the immortal "Death of Procris."
Admiration for stags and maidens&mdash;where was
it?</p>

<p>This analogy of pictures does not pretend that
our "new drama" is as far in front of the old as
the "Death of Procris" is in front of Landseer's
stags. Alas, no! It merely suggests that taste
is encouraged by an open mind, and is a matter
of gradual education.</p>

<p>To every man his sincere opinion! But before
we form opinions, let us all walk a little through
our National Gallery of drama, with inquiring
eye and open mind, to see and know for ourselves.
For, <i>to know</i>, a man cannot begin too young, cannot
leave off too old. And always he must have
a mind which feels it will never know enough. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
this way alone he <i>will</i>, perhaps, know something
before he dies.</p>

<p>And even if he require of the drama only buffoonery,
or a digestive for his dinner, why not be
able to discern good buffoonery from bad, and
the pure digestive from the drug?</p>

<p>One is, I suppose, prejudiced in favour of this
"new drama" of sincerity, of these poor productions
of the last fifteen years, or so. It may be,
indeed, that many of them will perish and fade
away. But they are, at all events, the expression
of the sincere moods of men who ask no
more than to serve an art, which, heaven knows,
has need of a little serving.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>So much for the principles underlying the advance
of the drama. But what about the chances
of drama itself under the new conditions which
will obtain when the war ends?</p>

<p>For the moment our world is still convulsed,
and art of every kind trails a lame foot before a
public whose eyes are fixed on the vast and bloody
stage of the war. When the last curtain falls,
and rises again on the scenery of Peace, shall we
have to revalue everything? Surely not the fundamental
truths; these reflections on the spirit
which underlie all true effort in dramatic art may
stand much as they were framed, now five years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
ago. Fidelity to mood, to impression, to self will
remain what it was&mdash;the very kernel of good
dramatic art; whether that fidelity will find a
more or less favourable environment remains the
interesting speculation. When we come to after-war
conditions a sharp distinction will have to be
drawn between the chances of sincere drama in
America and Britain. It is my strong impression
that sincere dramatists in America are going to
have an easier time than they had before the war,
but that with us they are going to have a harder.
My reasons are threefold. The first and chief
reason is economic. However much America
may now have to spend, with her late arrival,
vaster resources, and incomparably greater recuperative
power, she will feel the economic
strain but little in comparison with Britain.
Britain, not at once, but certainly within five
years of the war's close, will find that she has
very much less money to spend on pleasure.
Now, under present conditions of education,
when the average man has little to spend on
pleasure, he spends it first in gratifying his coarser
tastes. And the average Briton is going to spend
his little on having his broad laughs and his crude
thrills. By the time he has gratified that side of
himself he will have no money left. Those artists
in Britain who respect æsthetic truths and practise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
sincerity will lose even the little support they
ever had from the great public there; they will
have to rely entirely on that small public which
always wanted truth and beauty, and will want
it even more passionately after the war. But
that little public will be poorer also, and, I think,
not more numerous than it was. The British
public is going to be split more definitely into two
camps&mdash;a very big and a very little camp. What
this will mean to the drama of sincerity only those
who have watched its struggle in the past will be
able to understand. The trouble in Britain&mdash;and
I daresay in every country&mdash;is that the percentage
of people who take art of any kind seriously
is ludicrously small. And our impoverishment
will surely make that percentage smaller
by cutting off the recruiting which was always
going on from the ranks of the great public. How
long it will take Britain to recover even pre-war
conditions I do not venture to suggest. But I
am pretty certain that there is no chance for a
drama of truth and beauty there for many years
to come, unless we can get it endowed in such a
substantial way as shall tide it over&mdash;say&mdash;the
next two decades. What we require is a London
theatre undeviatingly devoted to the production
of nothing but the real thing, which will go
its own way, year in, year out, quite without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
regard to the great public; and we shall never get
it unless we can find some benevolent, public-spirited
person or persons who will place it in a
position of absolute security. If we could secure
this endowment, that theatre would become in a
very few years the most fashionable, if not the
most popular, in London, and even the great
public would go to it. Nor need such a theatre
be expensive&mdash;as theatres go&mdash;for it is to the
mind and not to the eye that it must appeal.
A sufficient audience is there ready; what is lacking
is the point of focus, a single-hearted and
coherent devotion to the best, and the means to
pursue that ideal without extravagance but without
halting. Alas! in England, though people
will endow or back almost anything else, they
will not endow or back an art theatre.</p>

<p>So much for the economic difficulty in Britain;
what about America? The same cleavage obtains
in public taste, of course, but numbers are
so much larger, wealth will be so much greater,
the spirit is so much more inquiring, the divisions
so much less fast set, that I do not anticipate for
America any block on the line. There will still
be plenty of money to indulge every taste.</p>

<p>Art, and especially, perhaps, dramatic art,
which of all is most dependent on a favourable
economic condition, will gravitate towards America,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
which may well become in the next ten years
not only the mother, but the foster-mother, of
the best Anglo-Saxon drama.</p>

<p>My next reason for thinking that sincerity in
art will have a better chance with Americans than
in Britain in the coming years is psychological.
They are so young a nation, we are so old; world-quakes
to them are such an adventure, to us a
nerve-racking, if not a health-shattering event.
They will take this war in their stride, we have
had to climb laboriously over it. They will be
left buoyant; we, with the rest of Europe, are
bound to lie for long years after in the trough of
disillusionment. The national mood with them
will be more than ever that of inquiry and exploit.
With us, unless I make a mistake, after a
spurt of hedonism&mdash;a going on the spree&mdash;there
will be lassitude. Every European country has
been overtried in this hideous struggle, and Nature,
with her principle of balance, is bound to
take redress. For Americans the war, nationally
speaking, will have been but a bracing of the
muscles and nerves, a clearing of the skin and
eyes. Such a mental and moral condition will
promote in them a deeper philosophy and a more
resolute facing of truth.</p>

<p>And that brings me to my third reason. The
American outlook will be permanently enlarged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
by this tremendous experience. Materially and
spiritually she will have been forced to witness
and partake of the life, thought, culture, and
troubles of the old world. She will have, unconsciously,
assimilated much, been diverted from
the beer and skittles of her isolated development
in a great new country. Americans will find
themselves suddenly grown up. Not till a man
is grown up does he see and feel things deeply
enough to venture into the dark well of sincerity.</p>

<p>America is an eager nation. She has always
been in a hurry. If I had to point out the capital
defect in the attractive temperament of the
American people, I should say it was a passion
for short cuts. That has been, in my indifferent
judgment, the very natural, the inevitable weakness
in America's spiritual development. The
material possibilities, the opportunities for growth
and change, the vast spaces, the climate, the
continual influxions of new blood and new habits,
the endless shifts of life and environment, all
these factors have been against that deep brooding
over things, that close and long scrutiny into
the deeper springs of life, out of which the sincerest
and most lasting forms of art emerge; nearly
all the conditions of American existence during
the last fifty years have been against the settled
life and atmosphere which influence men to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
re-creation in art form of that which has sunk
deep into their souls. Those who have seen the
paintings of the Italian artist Segantini will understand
what I mean. There have been many
painters of mountains, but none whom I know of
save he who has reproduced the very spirit of
those great snowy spaces. He spent his life
among them till they soaked into his nerves, into
the very blood of him. All else he gave up, to
see and feel them so that he might reproduce
them in his art. Or let me take an instance from
America. That enchanting work of art "Tom
Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn," by the great
Mark Twain. What reproduction of atmosphere
and life; what scent of the river, and old-time
country life, it gives off! How the author must
have been soaked in it to have produced those
books!</p>

<p>The whole tendency of our age has been away
from hand-made goods, away from the sort of
life which produced the great art of the past.
That is too big a subject to treat of here. But
certainly a sort of feverish impatience has possessed
us all, America not least. It may be said
that this will be increased by the war. I think
the opposite. Hard spiritual experience and contact
with the old world will deepen the American
character and cool its fevers, and Americans will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
be more thorough, less impatient, will give themselves
to art and to the sort of life which fosters
art, more than they have ever yet given themselves.
Great artists, like Whistler and Henry
James, will no longer seek their quiet environments
in Europe. I believe that this war will be
for America the beginning of a great art age; I
hope so with all my heart. For art will need a
kind home and a new lease of life.</p>

<p>A certain humble and yet patient and enduring
belief in himself and his own vision is necessary
to the artist. I think that Americans have only
just begun to believe in themselves as artists,
but that this belief is now destined to grow
quickly. America has a tremendous atmosphere
of her own, a wonderful life, a wonderful country,
but so far she has been skating over its surface.
The time has come when she will strike down,
think less in terms of material success and machine-made
perfections. The time has come
when she will brood, and interpret more and
more the underlying truths, and body forth an
art which shall be a spiritual guide, shed light,
and show the meaning of her multiple existence.
It will reveal dark things, but also those quiet
heights to which man's spirit turns for rest and
faith in this bewildering maze of a world. And
to this art about to come&mdash;art inevitably moves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
slowly&mdash;into its own, to American drama, poetry,
fiction, music, painting, sculpture&mdash;sincerity, an
unswerving fidelity to self, alone will bring the
dignity worthy of a great and free people.</p>

<p>"When we survey the world around, the wondrous
things which there abound"&mdash;especially
the developments of these last years&mdash;there must
come to some of us a doubt whether this civilisation
of ours is to have a future. Mr. Lowes Dickenson,
in an able book, "The Choice Before Us,"
has outlined the alternate paths which the world
may tread after the war&mdash;"National Militarism"
or "International Pacifism." He has pointed out
with force the terrible dangers on the first of these
two paths, the ruinous strain and ultimate destruction
which a journey down it will inflict on
every nation. But, holding a brief for International
Pacifism, he was not, in that book, at all
events, concerned to point out the dangers which
beset Peace. When, in the words of President
Wilson, we have made the world safe for democracy,
it will be high time to set about making it
safe against civilisation itself.</p>

<p>The first thing, naturally, is to ensure a good
long spell of peace. If we do not, we need not
trouble ourselves for a moment over the future
of civilisation&mdash;there will be none. But a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
spell of peace is probable; for, though human
nature is never uniform, and never as one man
shall we get salvation; sheer exhaustion, and disgust
with its present bed-fellows&mdash;suffering, sacrifice,
and sudden death&mdash;will almost surely force
the world into international quietude. For the
first time in history organised justice, such as for
many centuries has ruled the relations between
individuals, may begin to rule those between
States, and free us from menace of war for a
period which may be almost indefinitely prolonged.
To perpetuate this great change in the
life of nations is very much an affair of getting
men used to that change; of setting up a Tribunal
which they can see and pin their faith to, which
works, and proves its utility, which they would
miss if it were dissolved. States are proverbially
cynical, but if an International Court of Justice,
backed by international force, made good in the
settlement of two or three serious disputes, allayed
two or three crises, it would with each success
gain prestige, be firmer and more difficult to
uproot, till it might at last become as much a
matter of course in the eyes of the cynical States
as our Law Courts are in the eyes of our enlightened
selves.</p>

<p>Making, then, the large but by no means hopeless
assumption that such a change may come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
how is our present civilisation going to "pan
out"?</p>

<p>In Samuel Butler's imagined country, "Erewhon,"
the inhabitants had broken up all machinery,
abandoned the use of money, and lived
in a strange elysium of health and beauty. I
often wonder how, without something of the sort,
modern man is to be prevented from falling into
the trombone he blows so loudly, from being
destroyed by the very machines he has devised
for his benefit. The problem before modern man
is clearly that of becoming master, instead of
slave, of his own civilisation. The history of the
last hundred and fifty years, especially in England,
is surely one long story of ceaseless banquet
and acute indigestion. Certain Roman Emperors
are popularly supposed to have taken drastic
measures during their feasts to regain their appetites;
we have not their "slim" wisdom; we do
not mind going on eating when we have had too
much.</p>

<p>I do not question the intentions of civilisation&mdash;they
are most honourable. To be clean, warm,
well nourished, healthy, decently leisured, and
free to move quickly about the world, are certainly
pure benefits. And these are presumably
the prime objects of our toil and ingenuity, the
ideals to be served, by the discovery of steam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
electricity, modern industrial machinery, telephony,
flying. If we attained those ideals, and
stopped there&mdash;well and good. Alas! the amazing
mechanical conquests of the age have crowded
one on another so fast that we have never had
time to digest their effects. Each as it came we
hailed as an incalculable benefit to mankind, and
so it was, or would have been, if we had not the
appetites of cormorants and the digestive powers
of elderly gentlemen. Our civilisation reminds
one of the corpse in the Mark Twain story which,
at its own funeral, got up and rode with the
driver. It is watching itself being buried. We
discover, and scatter discovery broadcast among
a society uninstructed in the proper use of it.
Consider the town-ridden, parasitic condition of
Great Britain&mdash;<i>the country which cannot feed itself</i>.
If we are beaten in this war, it will be because we
have let our industrial system run away with us;
because we became so sunk in machines and
money-getting that we forgot our self-respect.
No self-respecting nation would have let its food-growing
capacity and its country life down to the
extent that we have. If we are beaten&mdash;which
God forbid&mdash;we shall deserve our fate. And why
did our industrial system get such a mad grip on
us? Because we did not master the riot of our
inventions and discoveries. Remember the spinning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
jenny&mdash;whence came the whole system of
Lancashire cotton factories which drained a
countryside of peasants and caused a deterioration
of physique from which as yet there has
been no recovery. Here was an invention which
was to effect a tremendous saving of labour and
be of sweeping benefit to mankind. Exploited
without knowledge, scruple, or humanity, it also
caused untold misery and grievous national harm.
Read, mark, and learn Mr. and Mrs. Hammond's
book, "The Town Labourer." The spinning
jenny and similar inventions have been the forces
which have dotted beautiful counties of England
with the blackest and most ill-looking towns in
the world, have changed the proportion of country- to
town-dwellers from about 3 as against 2
in 1761 to 2 as against 7 in 1911; have strangled
our powers to feed ourselves, and so made us a
temptation to our enemies and a danger to the
whole world. We have made money by it; our
standard of wealth has gone up. I remember
having a long talk with a very old shepherd on
the South Downs, whose youth and early married
life were lived on eight shillings a week; and
he was no exception. Nowadays our agricultural
wage averages over thirty shillings, though it
buys but little more than the eight. Still, the
standard of wealth has superficially advanced, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
that be any satisfaction. But have health,
beauty, happiness among the great bulk of the
population?</p>

<p>Consider the mastery of the air. To what use
has it been put, so far? To practically none,
save the destruction of life. About five years
before the war some of us in England tried to
initiate an international movement to ban the
use of flying for military purposes. The effort
was entirely abortive. The fact is, man never
goes in front of events, always insists on disastrously
buying his experience. And I am inclined
to think we shall continue to advance backwards
unless we intern our inventors till we have learned
to run the inventions of the last century instead
of letting them run us. Counsels of perfection,
however, are never pursued. But what <i>can</i> we
do? We can try to ban certain outside dangers
internationally, such as submarines and air-craft,
in war; and, inside, we might establish a Board
of Scientific Control to ensure that no inventions
are exploited under conditions obviously harmful.</p>

<p>Suppose, for instance, that the spinning jenny
had come before such a Board, one imagines they
might have said: "If you want to use this peculiar
novelty, you must first satisfy us that your
employees are going to work under conditions
favourable to health"&mdash;in other words, the Factory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Acts, Town Planning, and no Child Labour,
from the start. Or, when rubber was first introduced:
"You are bringing in this new and, we
dare say, quite useful article. We shall, however,
first send out and see the conditions under
which you obtain it." Having seen, they would
have added: "You will alter those conditions, and
treat your native labour humanely, or we will
ban your use of this article," to the grief and
anger of those periwig-pated persons who write
to the papers about grandmotherly legislation
and sickly sentimentalism.</p>

<p>Seriously, the history of modern civilisation
shows that, while we can only trust individualism
to make discoveries, we cannot at all trust it to
apply discovery without some sort of State check
in the interests of health, beauty, and happiness.
Officialdom is on all our nerves. But this is a
very vital matter, and the suggestion of a Board
of Scientific Control is not so fantastic as it seems.
Certain results of inventions and discoveries cannot,
of course, be foreseen, but able and impartial
brains could foresee a good many and save
mankind from the most rampant results of raw
and unconsidered exploitation. The public is a
child; and the child who suddenly discovers that
there is such a thing as candy, if left alone, can
only be relied on to make itself sick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Let us stray for a frivolous moment into the
realms of art, since the word art is claimed for
what we know as the "film." This discovery
went as it pleased for a few years in the hands of
inventors and commercial agents. In these few
years such a raging taste for cowboy, crime, and
Chaplin films has been developed, that a Commission
which has just been sitting on the matter
finds that the public will not put up with more
than a ten per cent. proportion of educational
film in the course of an evening's entertainment.
Now, the film as a means of transcribing actual
life is admittedly of absorbing interest and great
educational value; but, owing to this false start,
we cannot get it swallowed in more than extremely
small doses as a food and stimulant,
while it is being gulped down to the dregs as a
drug or irritant. Of the film's claim to the word
art I am frankly sceptical. My mind is open&mdash;and
when one says that, one generally means it
is shut. But art is long: the Cro-Magnon men
of Europe decorated the walls of their caves quite
beautifully, some say twenty-five, some say seventy,
thousand years ago; so it may well require a
generation to tell us what is art and what is not
among the new experiments continually being
made. Still, the film is a restless thing, and I
cannot think of any form of art, as hitherto we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
have understood the word, to which that description
could be applied, unless it be those Wagner
operas which I have disliked not merely since the
war began, but from childhood up. During the
filming of the play "Justice" I attended at rehearsal
to see Mr. Gerald du Maurier play the
cell scene. Since in that scene there is not a
word spoken in the play itself, there is no difference
in <i>kind</i> between the appeal of play or film.
But the live rehearsal for the filming was at least
twice as affecting as the dead result of that
rehearsal on the screen. The film, of course, is
in its first youth, but I see no signs as yet that it
will ever overcome the handicap of its physical
conditions, and attain the real emotionalising
powers of art. The film sweeps up into itself, of
course, a far wider surface of life in a far shorter
space of time; but the medium is flat, has no
blood in it; and experience tells one that no
amount of surface and quantity in art ever make
up for lack of depth and quality. Who would
not cheerfully give the Albert Memorial for a
little figure by Donatello! Since, however, the
film takes the line of least resistance, and makes a
rapid, lazy, superficial appeal, it may very well
oust the drama. And, to my thinking, of course,
that will be all to the bad, and intensely characteristic
of machine-made civilisation, whose motto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
seems to be: "Down with Shakespeare and Euripides&mdash;up
with the Movies!" The film is a very
good illustration of the whole tendency of modern
life under the too-rapid development of machines;
roughly speaking, we seem to be turning
up yearly more and more ground to less and less
depth. We are getting to know life as superficially
as the Egyptian interpreter knew language,
who, [as we read in the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>,]
when the authorities complained that he was
overstaying his leave, wrote back: "My absence
is impossible. Some one has removed my wife.
My God, I am annoyed."</p>

<p>There is an expression&mdash;"high-brow"&mdash;maybe
complimentary in origin, but become in some
sort a term of contempt. A doubter of our general
divinity is labelled "high-brow" at once, and
his doubts drop like water off the public's back.
Any one who questions our triumphant progress
is tabooed for a pedant. That will not alter the
fact, I fear, that we are growing feverish, rushed,
and complicated, and have multiplied conveniences
to such an extent that we do nothing with
them but scrape the surface of life. We were
rattling into a new species of barbarism when
the war came, and unless we take a pull, shall
continue to rattle after it is over. The underlying
cause in every country is the increase of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
herd-life, based on machines, money-getting, and
the dread of being dull. Every one knows how
fearfully strong that dread is. But to be capable
of being dull is in itself a disease.</p>

<p>And most of modern life seems to be a process
of creating disease, then finding a remedy which
in its turn creates another disease, demanding
fresh remedy, and so on. We pride ourselves,
for example, on scientific sanitation; well, what is
scientific sanitation if not one huge palliative of
evils, which have arisen from herd-life, enabling
herd-life to be intensified, so that we shall presently
need even more scientific sanitation? The
old shepherd on the South Downs had never come
in contact with it, yet he was very old, very
healthy, hardy, and contented. He had a sort
of simple dignity, too, that we have most of us
lost. The true elixirs <i>vitæ</i>&mdash;for there be two, I
think&mdash;are open-air life and a proud pleasure in
one's work; we have evolved a mode of existence
in which it is comparatively rare to find these two
conjoined. In old countries, such as Britain, the
evils of herd-life are at present vastly more acute
than in a new country such as America. On the
other hand, the further one is from hell the faster
one drives towards it, and machines are beginning
to run along with America even more violently
than with Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
When our Tanks first appeared they were described
as snouting monsters creeping at their
own sweet will. I confess that this is how my
inflamed eye sees all our modern machines&mdash;monsters
running on their own, dragging us along,
and very often squashing us.</p>

<p>We are, I believe, awakening to the dangers of
this "Gadarening," this rushing down the high
cliff into the sea, possessed and pursued by the
devils of&mdash;machinery. But if any man would
see how little alarmed he really is&mdash;let him ask
himself how much of his present mode of existence
he is prepared to alter. Altering the modes
of other people is delightful; one would have
great hope of the future if we had nothing before
us but that. The medieval Irishman, in Froude,
indicted for burning down the cathedral at
Armagh, together with the Archbishop, defended
himself thus: "As for the cathedral, 'tis true I
burned it; but indeed an' I wouldn't have, only
they told me himself was inside." We are all
ready to alter our opponents, if not to burn them.
But even if we were as ardent reformers as that
Irishman we could hardly force men to live in
the open, or take a proud pleasure in their work,
or enjoy beauty, or not concentrate themselves
on making money. No amount of legislation
will make us "lilies of the field" or "birds of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
air," or prevent us from worshipping false gods,
or neglecting to reform ourselves.</p>

<p>I once wrote the unpopular sentence, "Democracy
at present offers the spectacle of a man running
down a road followed at a more and more
respectful distance by his own soul." I am a
democrat, or I should never have dared. For
democracy, substitute "Modern Civilisation,"
which prides itself on redress after the event,
agility in getting out of the holes into which it
has snouted, and eagerness to snout into fresh
ones. It foresees nothing, and avoids less. It is
purely empirical, if one may use such a "high-brow"
word.</p>

<p>Politics are popularly supposed to govern the
direction, and statesmen to be the guardian
angels, of Civilisation. It seems to me that they
have little or no power over its growth. They
are of it, and move with it. Their concern is
rather with the body than with the mind or soul
of a nation. One needs not to be an engineer to
know that to pull a man up a wall one must be
higher than he; that to raise general taste one
must have better taste than that of those whose
taste he is raising.</p>

<p>Now, to my indifferent mind, education in the
large sense&mdash;not politics at all&mdash;is the only agent
really capable of improving the trend of civilisation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the only lever we can use. Believing this,
I think it a thousand pities that neither Britain
nor America, nor, so far as I know, any other
country, has as yet evolved machinery through
which there might be elected a supreme Director,
or, say, a little Board of three Directors, of the
nation's spirit, an Educational President, as it
were, with power over the nation's spirit analogous
to that which America's elected political President
has over America's body. Our Minister of
Education is as a rule an ordinary Member of the
Government, an ordinary man of affairs&mdash;though
at the moment an angel happens to have strayed
in. Why cannot education be regarded, like
religion in the past, as something sacred, not
merely a department of political administration?
Ought we not for this most vital business of education
to be ever on the watch for the highest
mind and the finest spirit of the day to guide us?
To secure the appointment of such a man, or
triumvirate, by democratic means, would need a
special sifting process of election, which could
never be too close and careful. One might use
for the purpose the actual body of teachers in
the country to elect delegates to select a jury to
choose finally the flower of the national flock.
It would be worth any amount of trouble to
ensure that we always had the best man or men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
And when we had them we should give them a
mandate as real and substantial as America now
gives to her political President. We should intend
them not for mere lay administrators and
continuers of custom, but for true fountain-heads
and initiators of higher ideals of conduct, learning,
manners, and taste; nor stint them of the
means necessary to carry those ideals into effect.
Hitherto, the supposed direction of ideals&mdash;in
practice almost none&mdash;has been left to religion.
But religion as a motive force is at once too personal,
too lacking in unanimity, and too specialised
to control the educational needs of a modern
State; religion, as I understand it, is essentially
emotional and individual; when it becomes practical
and worldly it strays outside its true province
and loses beneficence. Education as I want
to see it would take over the control of social
ethics, and learning, but make no attempt to
usurp the emotional functions of religion. Let
me give you an example: Those elixirs <i>vitæ</i>&mdash;open-air
life and a proud pleasure in one's work&mdash;imagine
those two principles drummed into the
heads and hearts of all the little scholars of the
age, by men and women who had been taught to
believe them the truth. Would this not gradually
have an incalculable effect on the trend of
our civilisation? Would it not tend to create a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
demand for a simple and sane life; help to get us
back to the land; produce reluctance to work at
jobs in which no one can feel pride and pleasure,
and so diminish the power of machines and of
commercial exploitation? But teachers could
only be inspired with such ideals by master spirits.
And my plea is that we should give ourselves the
chance of electing and making use of such master
spirits. We all know from everyday life and
business that the real, the only problem is to get
the best men to run the show; when we get them
the show runs well, when we don't there is nothing
left but to pay the devil. The chief defect
of modern civilisation based on democracy is the
difficulty of getting best men quickly enough.
Unless Democracy&mdash;government by the people&mdash;makes
of itself Aristocracy&mdash;government by the
best people&mdash;it is running steadily to seed. Democracy
to be sound must utilise not only the
ablest men of affairs, but the aristocracy of spirit.
The really vital concern of such an elected Head
of Education, himself the best man of all, would
be the discovery and employment of other best
men, best Heads of Schools and Colleges, whose
chief concern in turn would be the discovery and
employment of best subordinates. The better
the teacher the better the ideals; quite obviously,
the only hope of raising ideals is to raise the standard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
of those who teach, from top to toe of the
educational machine. What we want, in short, is
a sort of endless band&mdash;throwing up the finest
spirit of the day till he forms a head or apex
whence virtue runs swiftly down again into the
people who elected him. This is the principle, as
it seems to me, of the universe itself, whose symbol
is neither circle nor spire, but circle and spire
mysteriously combined.</p>

<p>America has given us an example of this in her
political system; perhaps she will now oblige in
her educational. I confess that I look very eagerly
and watchfully towards America in many ways.
After the war she will be more emphatically than
ever, in material things, the most important and
powerful nation of the earth. We British have a
legitimate and somewhat breathless interest in
the use she will make of her strength, and in the
course of her national life, for this will greatly
influence the course of our own. But power for
real light and leading in America will depend,
not so much on her material wealth, or her armed
force, as on what the attitude towards life and
the ideals of her citizens are going to be. Americans
have a certain eagerness for knowledge;
they have also, for all their absorption in success,
the aspiring eye. They do want the good thing.
They don't always know it when they see it, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
they want it. These qualities, in combination
with material strength, give America her chance.
Yet, if she does not set her face against "Gadarening,"
we are all bound for downhill. If she
goes in for spreadeagleism, if her aspirations are
towards quantity not quality, we shall all go on
being commonised. If she should get that purse-and-power-proud
fever which comes from national
success, we are all bound for another world
flare-up. The burden of proving that democracy
can be real and yet live up to an ideal of health
and beauty will be on America's shoulders, and
on ours. What are we and Americans going to
make of our inner life, of our individual habits of
thought? What are we going to reverence, and
what despise? Do we mean to lead in spirit and
in truth, not in mere money and guns? Britain
is an old country, still in her prime, I hope; but
America is as yet on the threshold. Is she to
step out into the sight of the world as a great
leader? That is for America the long decision,
to be worked out, not so much in her Senate and
her Congress, as in her homes and schools. On
America, after the war, the destiny of civilisation
may hang for the next century. If she mislays,
indeed, if she does not improve the power of self-criticism&mdash;that
special dry American humour
which the great Lincoln had&mdash;she might soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
develop the intolerant provincialism which has
so often been the bane of the earth and the undoing
of nations. If she gets swelled-head the
world will get cold-feet. Above all, if she does
not solve the problems of town life, of Capital
and Labour, of the distribution of wealth, of
national health, and attain to a mastery over
inventions and machinery&mdash;she is in for a cycle
of mere anarchy, disruption, and dictatorships,
into which we shall all follow. The motto "<i>noblesse
oblige</i>" applies as much to democracy as
ever it did to the old-time aristocrat. It applies
with terrific vividness to America. Ancestry and
Nature have bestowed on her great gifts. Behind
her stand Conscience, Enterprise, Independence,
and Ability&mdash;such were the companions of the
first Americans, and are the comrades of American
citizens to this day. She has abounding
energy, an unequalled spirit of discovery; a vast
territory not half developed, and great natural
beauty. I remember sitting on a bench overlooking
the Grand Canyon of Arizona; the sun
was shining into it, and a snow-storm was whirling
down there. All that most marvellous work
of Nature was flooded to the brim with rose and
tawny-gold, with white, and wine-dark shadows;
the colossal carvings as of huge rock-gods and
sacrificial altars, and great beasts, along its sides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
were made living by the very mystery of light
and darkness, on that violent day of spring&mdash;I
remember sitting there, and an old gentleman
passing close behind, leaning towards me and
saying in a sly, gentle voice: "How are you going
to tell it to the folks at home?" America has so
much that one despairs of telling to the folks at
home, so much grand beauty to be to her an inspiration
and uplift towards high and free thought
and vision. Great poems of Nature she has,
wrought in the large, to make of her and keep
her a noble people. In our beloved Britain&mdash;all
told, not half the size of Texas&mdash;there is a quiet
beauty of a sort which America has not. I walked
not long ago from Worthing to the little village
of Steyning, in the South Downs. It was such a
day as one too seldom gets in England; when the
sun was dipping and there came on the cool
chalky hills the smile of late afternoon, and
across a smooth valley on the rim of the Down
one saw a tiny group of trees, one little building,
and a stack, against the clear-blue, pale sky&mdash;it
was like a glimpse of Heaven, so utterly pure in
line and colour, so removed, and touching. The
tale of loveliness in our land is varied and unending,
but it is not in the grand manner. America
has the grand manner in her scenery and in her
blood, for over there all are the children of adventure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
and daring, every single white man an emigrant
himself or a descendant of one who had the
pluck to emigrate. She has already had past-masters
in dignity, but she has still to reach as a
nation the grand manner in achievement. She
knows her own dangers and failings, her qualities
and powers; but she cannot realise the intense
concern and interest, deep down behind our provoking
stolidities, with which we of the old country
watch her, feeling that what she does reacts
on us above all nations, and will ever react more
and more. Underneath surface differences and
irritations we English-speaking peoples are fast
bound together. May it not be in misery and
iron! If America walks upright, so shall we; if
she goes bowed under the weight of machines,
money, and materialism, we, too, shall creep our
ways. We run a long race, we nations; a generation
is but a day. But in a day a man may leave
the track, and never again recover it!</p>

<p>Democracies must not be content to leave the
ideals of health and beauty to artists and a leisured
class; that is the way into a treeless, waterless
desert. It has struck me forcibly that we
English-speaking democracies are all right underneath,
and all wrong on the surface; our hearts
are sound, but our skin is in a deplorable condition.
Our taste, take it all round, is dreadful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
For a petty illustration: Ragtime music. Judging
by its popularity, one would think it must be
a splendid discovery; yet it suggests little or
nothing but the comic love-making of two darkies.
We ride it to death; but its jigging, jogging, jumpy
jingle refuses to die on us, and America's young
and ours grow up in the tradition of its soul-forsaken
sounds. Take another tiny illustration:
The new dancing. Developed from cake-walk, to
fox-trot, by way of tango. Precisely the same
spiritual origin! And not exactly in the grand
manner to one who, like myself, loves and believes
in dancing. Take the "snappy" side of journalism.
In San Francisco a few years ago the Press
snapped a certain writer and his wife, in their
hotel, and next day there appeared a photograph
of two intensely wretched-looking beings stricken
by limelight, under the headline: "Blank and wife
enjoy freedom and gaiety in the air." Another
writer told me that as he set foot on a car leaving
a great city a young lady grabbed him by the
coat-tail and cried: "Say, Mr. Asterisk, what are
your views on a future life?" Not in the grand
manner, all this; but, if you like, a sign of vitality
and interest; a mere excrescence. But are not
these excrescences symptoms of a fever lying
within our modern civilisation, a febrility which
is going to make achievement of great ends and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
great work more difficult? We Britons, as a
breed, are admittedly stolid; we err as much on
that score as Americans on the score of restlessness;
yet we are both subject to these excrescences.
There is something terribly infectious about vulgarity;
and taste is on the down-grade following
the tendencies of herd-life. It is not a process to
be proud of.</p>

<p>Enough of Jeremiads, there is a bright side to
our civilisation.</p>

<p>This modern febrility does not seem able to
attack the real inner man. If there is a lamentable
increase of vulgarity, superficiality, and restlessness
in our epoch, there is also an inspiring
development of certain qualities. Those who
were watching human nature before the war were
pretty well aware of how, under the surface, unselfishness,
ironic stoicism, and a warm humanity
were growing. These are the great Town Virtues;
the fine flowers of herd-life. A big price is
being paid for them, but they are almost beyond
price. The war has revealed them in full bloom.
<i>Revealed them, not produced them!</i> Who, in the
future, with this amazing show before him, will
dare to talk about the need for war to preserve
courage and unselfishness? From the first shot
these wonders of endurance, bravery, and sacrifice
were shown by the untrained citizens of countries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
nearly fifty years deep in peace! Never, I suppose,
in the world's history, has there been so
marvellous a display, in war, of the bedrock virtues.
The soundness at core of the modern man
has had one long triumphant demonstration.
Out of a million instances, take that little story of
a Mr. Lindsay, superintendent of a pumping station
at some oil-wells in Mesopotamia. A valve
in the oil-pipe had split, and a fountain of oil was
being thrown up on all sides, while, thirty yards
off, and nothing between, the furnaces were in
full blast. To prevent a terrible conflagration
and great loss of life, and to save the wells, it was
necessary to shut off those furnaces. That meant
dashing through the oil-stream and arriving saturated
at the flames. The superintendent did not
hesitate a moment, and was burnt to death.
Such deeds as this men and women have been
doing all through the war.</p>

<p>When you come to think, this modern man is
a very new and marvellous creature. Without
quite realising it, we have evolved a fresh species
of stoic, even more stoical, I suspect, than were
the old Stoics. Modern man has cut loose from
leading-strings; he stands on his own feet. His
religion is to take what comes without flinching
or complaint, as part of the day's work, which
an unknowable God, Providence, Creative Principle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
or whatever it shall be called, has appointed.
Observation tells me that modern man at large,
far from inclining towards the new, personal,
elder-brotherly God of Mr. Wells, has turned his
face the other way. He confronts life and death
alone. By courage and kindness modern man
exists, warmed by the glow of the great human
fellowship. He has re-discovered the old Greek
saying: "God is the helping of man by man"; has
found out in his unselfconscious way that if he
does not help himself, and help his fellows, he
cannot reach that inner peace which satisfies.
To do his bit, and to be kind! It is by that
creed, rather than by any mysticism, that he
finds the salvation of his soul. His religion is to
be a common-or-garden hero, without thinking
anything of it; for, of a truth, this is the age of
conduct.</p>

<p>After all, does not the only real spiritual
warmth, not tinged by Pharisaism, egotism, or
cowardice, come from the feeling of doing your
work well and helping others; is not all the rest
embroidery, luxury, pastime, pleasant sound and
incense? Modern man, take him in the large,
does not believe in salvation to beat of drum; or
that, by leaning up against another person, however
idolised and mystical, he can gain support.
He is a realist with too romantic a sense, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
of the mystery which surrounds existence to pry
into it. And, like modern civilisation itself, he
is the creature of West and North, of atmospheres,
climates, manners of life which foster neither inertia,
reverence, nor mystic meditation. Essentially
man of action, in ideal action he finds his
only true comfort; and no attempts to discover
for him new gods and symbols will divert him
from the path made for him by the whole trend
of his existence. I am sure that padres at the
front see that the men whose souls they have
gone out to tend are living the highest form of
religion; that in their comic courage, unselfish
humanity, their endurance without whimper of
things worse than death, they have gone beyond
all pulpit-and-death-bed teaching. And who are
these men? Just the early manhood of the race,
just modern man as he was before the war began
and will be when the war is over.</p>

<p>This modern world, of which we English and
Americans are perhaps the truest types, stands
revealed, from beneath its froth, frippery, and
vulgar excrescences, sound at core&mdash;a world
whose implicit motto is: "The good of all humanity."
But the herd-life, which is its characteristic,
brings many evils, has many dangers; and
to preserve a sane mind in a healthy body is the
riddle before us. Somehow we must free ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
from the driving domination of machines
and money-getting, not only for our own sakes
but for that of all mankind.</p>

<p>And there is another thing of the most solemn
importance: We English-speaking nations are by
chance as it were the ballast of the future. It is
<i>absolutely necessary</i> that we should remain united.
The comradeship we now feel must and surely
shall abide. For unless we work together, and in
no selfish or exclusive spirit&mdash;good-bye to Civilisation!
It will vanish like the dew off grass.
The betterment not only of the British nations
and America, but of all mankind, is and must be
our object.</p>

<p>When from all our hearts this great weight is
lifted; when no longer in those fields death sweeps
his scythe, and our ears at last are free from the
rustling thereof&mdash;then will come the test of magnanimity
in all countries. Will modern man rise
to the ordering of a sane, a free, a generous life?
Each of us loves his own country best, be it a little
land or the greatest on earth; but jealousy is
the dark thing, the creeping poison. Where there
is true greatness, let us acclaim it; where there
is true worth, let us prize it&mdash;as if it were our
own.</p>

<p>This earth is made too subtly, of too multiple
warp and woof, for prophecy. When he surveys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
the world around, the wondrous things which
there abound, the prophet closes foolish lips.
Besides, as the historian tells us: "Writers have
that undeterminateness of spirit which commonly
makes literary men of no use in the world." So
I, for one, prophesy not. Still, we do know this:
All English-speaking peoples will go to the adventure
of peace with something of big purpose and
spirit in their hearts, with something of free outlook.
The world is wide and Nature bountiful
enough for all, if we keep sane minds. The earth
is fair and meant to be enjoyed, if we keep sane
bodies. Who dare affront this world of beauty
with mean views? There is no darkness but
what the ape in us still makes, and in spite of all
his monkey-tricks modern man is at heart further
from the ape than man has yet been.</p>

<p>To do our jobs really well and to be brotherly!
To seek health, and ensue beauty! If, in Britain
and America, in all the English-speaking nations,
we can put that simple faith into real and thorough
practice, what may not this century yet bring
forth? Shall man, the highest product of creation,
be content to pass his little day in a house,
like unto Bedlam?</p>

<p>When the present great task in which we have
joined hands is ended; when once more from the
shuttered mad-house the figure of Peace steps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
forth and stands in the sun, and we may go our
ways again in the beauty and wonder of a new
morning&mdash;let it be with this vow in our hearts:
"No more of Madness&mdash;in War, in <i>Peace</i>!"</p>

<h2>THE LAND, 1917</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>If once more through ingenuity, courage, and
good luck we find the submarine menace "well
in hand," and go to sleep again&mdash;if we reach the
end of the war without having experienced any
sharp starvation, and go our ways to trade, to
eat, and forget&mdash;What then? It is about twenty
years since the first submarine could navigate&mdash;and
about seventeen since flying became practicable.
There are a good many years yet before
the world, and numberless developments in front
of these new accomplishments. Hundreds of miles
are going to be what tens are now; thousands of
machines will take the place of hundreds.</p>

<p>We have ceased to live on an island in any save
a technically geographical sense, and the sooner
we make up our minds to the fact, the better. If
in the future we act as we have in the past&mdash;rather
the habit of this country&mdash;I can imagine that in
fifteen years' time or so we shall be well enough
prepared against war of the same magnitude and
nature as this war, and that the country which
attacks us will launch an assault against defences
as many years out of date.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
I can imagine a war starting and well-nigh ending
at once, by a quiet and simultaneous sinking,
from under water and from the air, of most
British ships, in port or at sea. I can imagine
little standardised submarines surreptitiously prepared
by the thousand, and tens of thousands of
the enemy population equipped with flying machines,
instructed in flying as part of their ordinary
civil life, and ready to serve their country
at a moment's notice, by taking a little flight
and dropping a little charge of an explosive many
times more destructive than any in use now.
The agility of submarines and flying machines
will grow almost indefinitely. And even if we
carry our commerce under the sea instead of on
the surface, we shall not be guaranteed against
attack by air. The air menace is, in fact, infinitely
greater than that from under water. I
can imagine all shipping in port, the Houses of
Parliament, the Bank of England, most commercial
buildings of importance, and every national
granary wrecked or fired in a single night, on a
declaration of war springing out of the blue. The
only things I cannot imagine wrecked or fired are
the British character and the good soil of Britain.</p>

<p>These are sinister suggestions, but there is
really no end to what might now be done to us
by any country which deliberately set its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
interests and safety above all considerations of
international right, especially if such country
were moved to the soul by longing for revenge,
and believed success certain. After this world-tragedy
let us hope nations may have a little
sense, less of that ghastly provincialism whence
this war sprang; that no nation may teach in its
schools that it is God's own people, entitled to
hack through, without consideration of others;
that professors may be no longer blind to all
sense of proportion; Emperors things of the past;
diplomacy open and responsible; a real Court of
Nations at work; Military Chiefs unable to stampede
a situation; journalists obliged to sign their
names and held accountable for inflammatory
writings. Let us hope, and let us by every means
endeavour to bring about this better state of the
world. But there is many a slip between cup
and lip; there is also such a thing as hatred. And
to rely blindly on a peace which, at the best,
must take a long time to prove its reality, is to
put our heads again under our wings. Once bit,
twice shy. We shall make a better world the
quicker if we try realism for a little.</p>

<p>Britain's situation is now absurdly weak, without
and within. And its weakness is due to one
main cause&mdash;<i>the fact that we do not grow our own
food</i>. To get the better of submarines in this war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
will make no difference to our future situation.
A little peaceful study and development of submarines
and aircraft will antiquate our present
antidotes. You cannot chain air and the deeps
to war uses and think you have done with their
devilish possibilities a score of years afterwards
because for the moment the submarine menace
or the air menace is "well in hand."</p>

<p>At the end of the war I suppose the Channel
Tunnel will be made. And quite time too! But
even that will not help us. We get no food from
Europe, and never shall again. Not even by
linking ourselves to Europe can we place ourselves
in security from Europe. Faith may remove
mountains, but it will not remove Britain to the
centre of the Atlantic. Here we shall remain,
every year nearer and more accessible to secret
and deadly attack.</p>

<p>The next war, if there be one&mdash;which Man forbid&mdash;may
be fought without the use of a single
big ship or a single infantryman. It may begin,
instead of ending, by being a war of starvation;
it may start, as it were, where it leaves off this
time. And the only way of making even reasonably
safe is to grow our own food. If for years
to come we have to supplement by State granaries,
they must be placed underground; not even
there will they be too secure. Unless we grow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
our own food after this war we shall be the only
great country which does not, and a constant
temptation to any foe. To be self-sufficing will
be the first precaution taken by our present enemies,
in order that blockade may no longer be a
weapon in our hands, so far as <i>their</i> necessary
food is concerned.</p>

<p>Whatever arrangements the world makes after
the war to control the conduct of nations in the
future, the internal activities of those nations
will remain unfettered, capable of deadly shaping
and plausible disguise in the hands of able
and damnable schemers.</p>

<p>The submarine menace of the present is merely
awkward, and no doubt surmountable&mdash;it is nothing
to the submarine-<i>cum</i>-air menace of peace
time a few years hence. <i>It will be impossible to
guard against surprise under the new conditions.</i>
If we do not grow our own food, we could be
knocked out of time in the first round.</p>

<p>But besides the danger from overseas, we have
an inland danger to our future just as formidable&mdash;the
desertion of our countryside and the town-blight
which is its corollary.</p>

<p>Despair seizes on one reading that we should
cope with the danger of the future by new cottages,
better instruction to farmers, better kinds
of manure and seed, encouragement to co-operative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
societies, a cheerful spirit, and the storage
of two to three years' supply of grain. Excellent
and necessary, in their small ways&mdash;they are a
mere stone to the bread we need.</p>

<p>In that programme and the speech which put it
forward I see insufficient grasp of the outer peril
and hardly any of the gradual destruction with
which our overwhelming town life threatens us;
not one allusion to the physical and moral welfare
of our race, except this: "That boys should
be in touch with country life and country tastes
is of first importance, and that their elementary
education should be given in terms of country
things is also of enormous importance." That is
all, and it shows how far we have got from reality,
and how difficult it will be to get back; for the
speaker was once Minister for Agriculture.</p>

<p>Our justifications for not continuing to feed
ourselves were: Pursuit of wealth, command of
the sea, island position. Whatever happens in
this war, we have lost the last two in all but a
superficial sense. Let us see whether the first is
sufficient justification for perseverance in a mode
of life which has brought us to an ugly pass.</p>

<p>Our wonderful industrialism began about 1766,
and changed us from exporting between the years
1732 and 1766 11,250,000 quarters of wheat to
importing 7,500,000 quarters between the years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
1767 and 1801. In one hundred and fifty years
it has brought us to the state of importing more
than three-quarters of our wheat, and more than
half our total food. Whereas in 1688 (figures of
Gregory and Davenant) about four-fifths of the
population of England was rural, in 1911 only
about two-ninths was rural. This transformation
has given us great wealth, extremely ill-distributed;
plastered our country with scores of
busy, populous, and hideous towns; given us a
merchant fleet which before the war had a gross
tonnage of over 20,000,000, or not far short of
half the world's shipping. It has, or had, fixed
in us the genteel habit of eating very doubtfully
nutritious white bread made of the huskless flour
of wheat; reduced the acreage of arable land in
the United Kingdom from its already insufficient
maximum of 23,000,000 acres to its 1914 figure of
19,000,000 acres; made England, all but its towns,
look very like a pleasure garden; and driven two
shibboleths deep into our minds, "All for wealth"
and "Hands off the food of the people."</p>

<p>All these "good" results have had certain complementary
disadvantages, some of which we
have just seen, some of which have long been
seen.</p>

<p>Of these last, let me first take a small sentimental
disadvantage. We have become more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
parasitic by far than any other nation. To eat
we have to buy with our manufactures an overwhelming
proportion of our vital foods. The
blood in our veins is sucked from foreign bodies,
in return for the clothing we give them&mdash;not a
very self-respecting thought. We have a green
and fertile country, and round it a prolific sea.
Our country, if we will, can produce, with its
seas, all the food we need to eat. We know that
quite well, but we elect to be nourished on foreign
stuff, because we are a practical people and prefer
shekels to sentiment. We do not mind being
parasitic. Taking no interest nationally in the
growth of food, we take no interest nationally in
the cooking of it; the two accomplishments subtly
hang together. Pride in the food capacity, the
corn and wine and oil, of their country has made
the cooking of the French the most appetising
and nourishing in the world. The French do
cook: we open tins. The French preserve the
juices of their home-grown food: we have no
juices to preserve. The life of our poorer classes
is miserably stunted of essential salts and savours.
They throw away skins, refuse husks, make no
soups, prefer pickle to genuine flavour. But
home-grown produce really is more nourishing
than tinned and pickled and frozen foods. If we
honestly feed ourselves we shall not again demand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
the old genteel flavourless white bread without
husk or body in it; we shall eat wholemeal bread,
and take to that salutary substance, oatmeal,
which, if I mistake not, has much to say in making
the Scots the tallest and boniest race in
Europe.</p>

<p>Now for a far more poignant disadvantage.
We have become tied up in teeming congeries, to
which we have grown so used that we are no
longer able to see the blight they have brought
on us. Our great industrial towns, sixty odd in
England alone, with a population of 15,000,000
to 16,000,000, are our glory, our pride, and the
main source of our wealth. They are the growth,
roughly speaking, of five generations. They
began at a time when social science was unknown,
spread and grew in unchecked riot of individual
moneymaking, till they are the nightmare of
social reformers, and the despair of all lovers
of beauty. They have mastered us so utterly,
morally and physically, that we regard them and
their results as matter of course. They <i>are</i> public
opinion, so that for the battle against town-blight
there is no driving force. They paralyse
the imaginations of our politicians because their
voting power is so enormous, their commercial
interests are so huge, and the food necessities of
their populations seem so paramount.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
I once bewailed the physique of our towns to
one of our most cultivated and prominent Conservative
statesmen. He did not agree. He
thought that probably physique was on the up-grade.
This commonly held belief is based on
statistics of longevity and sanitation. But the
same superior sanitation and science applied to a
rural population would have lengthened the lives
of a much finer and better-looking stock. Here
are some figures: Out of 1,650 passers-by, women
and men, observed in perhaps the "best" district
of London&mdash;St. James's Park, Trafalgar Square,
Westminster Bridge, and Piccadilly&mdash;in May of
this year, only 310 had any pretensions to not
being very plain or definitely ugly-not one in
five. And out of that 310 only eleven had what
might be called real beauty. Out of 120 British
soldiers observed round Charing Cross, sixty&mdash;just
one-half&mdash;passed the same standard. But
out of seventy-two Australian soldiers, fifty-four,
or three-quarters, passed, and several had real
beauty. Out of 120 men, women, and children
taken at random in a remote country village (five
miles from any town, and eleven miles from any
town of 10,000 inhabitants) ninety&mdash;or just three-quarters
also&mdash;pass this same standard of looks.
It is significant that the average here is the same
as the average among Australian soldiers, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
though of British stock, come from a country as
yet unaffected by town life. You ask, of course,
what standard is this? A standard which covers
just the very rudiments of proportion and comeliness.
People in small country towns, I admit,
have little or no more beauty than people in large
towns. This is curious, but may be due to too
much inbreeding.</p>

<p>The first counter to conclusions drawn from
such figures is obviously: "The English are an
ugly people." I said that to a learned and
æsthetic friend when I came back from France
last spring. He started, and then remarked:
"Oh, well; not as ugly as the French, anyway."
A great error; much plainer if you take <i>the bulk,
and not the pick</i>, of the population in both countries.
It may not be fair to attribute French
superiority in looks entirely to the facts that they
grow nearly all their own food (and cook it well),
and had in 1906 four-sevenths of their population
in the country as against our own two-ninths in
1911, because there is the considerable matter of
climate. But when you get so high a proportion
of comeliness in <i>remote</i> country districts in England,
it <i>is</i> fair to assume that climate does not
account for anything like all the difference. I
do not believe that the English are naturally an
ugly people. The best English type is perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
the handsomest in the world. The physique and
looks of the richer classes are as notoriously better
than those of the poorer classes as the physique
and looks of the remote country are superior
to those of crowded towns. Where conditions
are free from cramp, poor air, poor food,
and <i>herd-life</i>, English physique quite holds its
own with that of other nations.</p>

<p>We do not realise the great deterioration of our
stock, the squashed-in, stunted, disproportionate,
commonised look of the bulk of our people, because,
as we take our walks abroad, we note only
faces and figures which strike us as good-looking;
the rest pass unremarked. Ugliness has become
a matter of course. There is no reason, save
town life, why this should be so. But what does
it matter if we <i>have</i> become ugly? We work
well, make money, and have lots of moral qualities.
A fair inside is better than a fair outside.
I do think that we are in many ways a very
wonderful people; and our townsfolk not the least
wonderful. But that is all the more reason for
trying to preserve our physique.</p>

<p>Granted that an expressive face, with interest
in life stamped on it, is better than "chocolate
box" or "barber's block" good looks, that agility
and strength are better than symmetry without
agility and strength; the trouble is that there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
no interest stamped on so many of our faces, no
agility or strength in so many of our limbs. If
there were, those faces and limbs would pass my
standard. The old Greek cult of the body was
not to be despised. I defy even the most rigid
Puritans to prove that a satisfactory moral condition
can go on within an exterior which exhibits
no signs of a live, able, and serene existence. By
living on its nerves, overworking its body, starving
its normal aspirations for fresh air, good food,
sunlight, and a modicum of solitude, a country
can get a great deal out of itself, a terrific lot of
wealth, in three or four generations; but it is living
on its capital, physically speaking. This is
precisely what we show every sign of doing; and
partly what I mean by "town-blight."</p>


<h3>
<br />
II</h3>

<p>The impression I get, in our big towns, is most
peculiar&mdash;considering that we are a free people.
The faces and forms have a look of being possessed.
To express my meaning exactly is difficult.
There is a dulled and driven look, and yet
a general expression of "Keep smiling&mdash;Are we
down-hearted? No." It is as if people were all
being forced along by a huge invisible hand at
the back of their necks, whose pressure they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
resent yet are trying to make the best of, because
they cannot tell whence it comes. To understand,
you must watch the grip from its very
beginnings. The small children who swarm in
the little grey playground streets of our big towns
pass their years in utter abandonment. They
roll and play and chatter in conditions of amazing
unrestraint and devil-may-care-dom in the midst
of amazing dirt and ugliness. The younger they
are, as a rule, the chubbier and prettier they are.
Gradually you can see herd-life getting hold of
them, the impact of ugly sights and sounds commonising
the essential grace and individuality of
their little features. On the lack of any standard
or restraint, any real glimpse of Nature, any
knowledge of a future worth striving for, or indeed
of any future at all, they thrive forward
into that hand-to-mouth mood from which they
are mostly destined never to emerge. Quick and
scattery as monkeys, and never alone, they become,
at a rake's progress, little fragments of the
herd. On poor food, poor air, and habits of least
resistance, they wilt and grow distorted, acquiring
withal the sort of pathetic hardihood which
a Dartmoor pony will draw out of moor life in a
frozen winter. All round them, by day, by
night, stretches the huge, grey, grimy waste of
streets, factory walls, chimneys, murky canals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
chapels, public-houses, hoardings, posters, butchers'
shops&mdash;a waste where nothing beautiful exists
save a pretty cat or pigeon, a blue sky, perhaps,
and a few trees and open spaces. The children of
the class above, too, of the small shop-people,
the artisans&mdash;do they escape? Not really. The
same herd-life and the same sights and sounds
pursue them from birth; they also are soon
divested of the grace and free look which you
see in country children walking to and from
school or roaming the hedges. Whether true
slum children, or from streets a little better off,
quickly they all pass out of youth into the iron
drive of commerce and manufacture, into the
clang and clatter, the swish and whirr of wheels,
the strange, dragging, saw-like hubbub of industry,
or the clicking and pigeon-holes of commerce;
perch on a devil's see-saw from monotonous work
to cheap sensation and back. Considering the
conditions it is wonderful that they stand it as
well as they do; and I should be the last to deny
that they possess remarkable qualities. But the
modern industrial English town is a sort of inferno
where people dwell with a marvellous philosophy.
What would you have? They have
never seen any way out of it. And this, perhaps,
would not be so pitiful if for each bond-servant
of our town-tyranny there was in store a prize&mdash;some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
portion of that national wealth in pursuit
of which the tyrant drives us; if each worker had
before him the chance of emergence at, say, fifty.
But, Lord God! for five that emerge, ninety-and-five
stay bound, less free and wealthy at the end
of the chapter than they were at the beginning.
And the quaint thing is&mdash;they know it; know
that they will spend their lives in smoky, noisy,
crowded drudgery, and in crowded drudgery die.
Wealth goes to wealth, and all they can hope for
is a few extra shillings a week, with a corresponding
rise in prices. They know it, but it does not
disturb them, for they were born of the towns,
have never glimpsed at other possibilities. Imprisoned
in town life from birth, they contentedly
perpetuate the species of a folk with an ebbing
future. Yes, ebbing! For if it be not, why is
there now so much conscious effort to arrest the
decay of town workers' nerves and sinews? Why
do we bother to impede a process which is denied?
If there be no town-blight on us, why a million
indications of uneasiness and a thousand little
fights against the march of a degeneration so
natural, vast, and methodical, that it brings them
all to naught? Our physique is slowly rotting,
and that is the plain truth of it.</p>

<p>But it does not stop with deteriorated physique.
Students of faces in the remoter country are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
struck by the absence of what, for want of a
better word, we may call vulgarity. That insidious
defacement is seen to be a thing of towns,
and not at all a matter of "class." The simplest
country cottager, shepherd, fisherman, has as
much, often a deal more, dignity than numbers of
our upper classes, who, in spite of the desire to
keep themselves unspotted, are still, from the
nature of their existence, touched by the herd-life
of modern times. For vulgarity is the natural
product of herd-life; an amalgam of second-hand
thought, cheap and rapid sensation, defensive and
offensive self-consciousness, gradually plastered
over the faces, manners, voices, whole beings, of
those whose elbows are too tightly squeezed to
their sides by the pressure of their fellows, whose
natures are cut off from Nature, whose senses are
rendered imitative by the too insistent impact of
certain sights and sounds. Without doubt the
rapid increase of town-life is responsible for our
acknowledged vulgarity. The same process is
going on in America and in Northern Germany;
but we unfortunately had the lead, and seem to
be doing our best to keep it. Cheap newspapers,
on the sensational tip-and-run system, perpetual
shows of some kind or other, work in association,
every kind of thing in association, at a speed too
great for individual digestion, and in the presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
of every device for removing the need for individual
thought; the thronged streets, the football
match with its crowd emotions; beyond all, the
cinema&mdash;a compendium of all these other influences&mdash;make
town-life a veritable forcing-pit of
vulgarity. We are all so deeply in it that we do
not see the process going on; or, if we admit it,
hasten to add: "But what does it matter?&mdash;there's
no harm in vulgarity; besides, it's inevitable,
you can't set the tide back." Obviously,
the vulgarity of town-life cannot be exorcised by
Act of Parliament; there is not indeed the faintest
chance that Parliament will recognise such a side
to the question at all, since there is naturally no
public opinion on this matter.</p>

<p>Everybody must recognise and admire certain
qualities specially fostered by town-life; the
extraordinary patience, cheerful courage, philosophic
irony, and unselfishness of our towns-people&mdash;qualities
which in this war, both at the
front and at home, have been of the greatest
value. They are worth much of the price paid.
But in this life all is a question of balance; and
my contention is, not so much that town-life in
itself is bad, as that we have pushed it to a point
of excess terribly dangerous to our physique, to
our dignity, and to our sense of beauty. Must
our future have no serene and simple quality, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
even a spice of the influence of Nature, with her
air, her trees, her fields, and wide skies? Say
what you like, it is elbow-room for limbs and
mind and lungs which keeps the countryman free
from that dulled and driven look, and gives him
individuality. I know all about the "dullness"
and "monotony" of rural life, bad housing and
the rest of it. All true enough, but the cure is
not exodus, it is improvement in rural-life conditions,
more co-operation, better cottages, a fuller,
freer social life. What we in England now want
more than anything is air&mdash;for lungs and mind.
We have overdone herd-life. We <i>are</i> dimly conscious
of this, feel vaguely that there is something
"rattling" and wrong about our progress, for we
have had many little spasmodic "movements"
back to the land these last few years. But what
do they amount to? Whereas in 1901 the proportion
of town to country population in England
and Wales was 3&nbsp;10/37&mdash;1, in 1911 it was 3&nbsp;17/20&mdash;1;
very distinctly greater! At this crab's march we
shall be some time getting "back to the land."
Our effort, so far, has been something like our
revival of Morris dancing, very pleasant and
æsthetic, but without real economic basis or
strength to stand up against the lure of the towns.
And how queer, ironical, and pitiful is that lure,
when you consider that in towns one-third of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
population are just on or a little below the line
of bare subsistence; that the great majority of
town workers have hopelessly monotonous work,
stuffy housing, poor air, and little leisure. But
there it is&mdash;the charm of the lighted-up unknown,
of company, and the streets at night! The countryman
goes to the town in search of adventure.
Honestly&mdash;does he really find it? He thinks he
is going to improve his prospects and his mind.
His prospects seldom brighten. He sharpens his
mind, only to lose it and acquire instead that of
the herd.</p>

<p>To compete with this lure of the towns, there
must first be <i>national</i> consciousness of its danger;
then coherent <i>national</i> effort to fight it. We
must destroy the shibboleth: "All for wealth!"
and re-write it: "All for health!"&mdash;the only
wealth worth having. Wealth is not an end,
surely. Then, to what is it the means, if not to
health? Once we admit that in spite of our
wealth our national health is going downhill
through town-blight, we assert the failure of our
country's ideals and life. And if, having got into
a vicious state of congested town existence, we
refuse to make an effort to get out again, because
it is necessary to "hold our own commercially,"
and feed "the people" cheaply, we are in effect
saying: "We certainly are going to hell, but look&mdash;how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
successfully!" I suggest rather that we
try to pull ourselves up again out of the pit of
destruction, even if to do so involves us in a certain
amount of monetary loss and inconvenience.
Yielding to no one in desire that "the people"
should be well, nay better, fed, I decline utterly
to accept the doctrine that there is no way of
doing this compatible with an increased country
population and the growth of our own food. In
national matters, where there is a general and not
a mere Party will, there is a way, and the way is
not to be recoiled from because the first years of
the change may necessitate Governmental regulation.
Many people hold that our salvation
will come through education. Education on right
lines underlies everything, of course; but unless
education includes the growth of our own food
and return to the land in substantial measure,
education cannot save us.</p>

<p>It may be natural to want to go to hell; it is certainly
easy; we have gone so far in that direction
that we cannot hope to be haloed in our time. For
good or evil, the great towns are here, and we can
but mitigate. The indicated policy of mitigation
is fivefold:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Such solid economic basis to the growth of
our food as will give us again national security,
more arable land than we have ever had, and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
it a full complement of well-paid workers, with
better cottages, and a livened village life.</p>

<p>(2) A vast number of small holdings, State-created,
with co-operative working.</p>

<p>(3) A wide belt-system of garden allotments
round every town, industrial or not.</p>

<p>(4) Drastic improvements in housing, feeding,
and sanitation in the towns themselves.</p>

<p>(5) Education that shall raise not only the
standard of knowledge but the standard of taste
in town and country.</p>

<p>All these ideals are already well in the public
eye&mdash;on paper. But they are incoherently viewed
and urged; they do not as yet form a national
creed. Until welded and supported by all parties
in the State, they will not have driving power
enough to counteract the terrific momentum with
which towns are drawing us down into the pit.
One section pins its faith to town improvement;
another to the development of small holdings; a
third to cottage building; a fourth to education;
a fifth to support of the price of wheat; a sixth to
the destruction of landlords. Comprehensive
vision of the danger is still lacking, and comprehensive
grasp of the means to fight against it.</p>

<p>We are by a long way the most town-ridden
country in the world; our towns by a long way
the smokiest and worst built, with the most inbred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
town populations. We have practically
come to an end of our country-stock reserves.
Unless we are prepared to say: "This is a desirable
state of things; let the inbreeding of town
stocks go on&mdash;we shall evolve in time a new type
immune to town life; a little ratty fellow all nerves
and assurance, much better than any country
clod!"&mdash;which, by the way, is exactly what some
of us do say! Unless we mean as a nation to
adopt this view and rattle on, light-heartedly,
careless of menace from without and within, assuring
ourselves that health and beauty, freedom
and independence, as hitherto understood, have
always been misnomers, and that nothing whatever
matters so long as we are rich&mdash;unless all
this, we must give check to the present state of
things, restore a decent balance between town
and country stock, grow our own food, and establish
a permanent tendency away from towns.</p>

<p>All this fearfully unorthodox and provocative
of sneers, and&mdash;goodness knows&mdash;I do not enjoy
saying it. But needs must when the devil drives.
It may be foolish to rave against the past and
those factors and conditions which have put us
so utterly in bond to towns&mdash;especially since this
past and these towns have brought us such great
wealth and so dominating a position in the world.
It cannot be foolish, now that we have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
wealth and the position, to resolve with all our
might to free ourselves from bondage, to be masters,
not servants, of our fate, to get back to firm
ground, and make Health and Safety what they
ever should be&mdash;the true keystones of our policy.</p>


<h3>
<br />
III</h3>

<p>In the midst of a war like this the first efforts of
any Government have to be directed to immediate
ends. But under the pressure of the war the Government
has a unique chance to initiate the comprehensive,
far-reaching policy which alone can
save us. Foundations to safety will only be laid
if our representatives can be induced now to see
this question of the land as <i>the</i> question of the
future, no matter what happens in the war; to
see that, whatever success we attain, we cannot
remove the two real dangers of the future, sudden
strangulation through swift attack by air and
under sea&mdash;unless we grow our own food; and slow
strangulation by town-life&mdash;unless we restore the
land. Our imaginations are stirred, the driving
force is here, swift action possible, and certain
extraordinary opportunities are open which presently
must close again.</p>

<p>On demobilisation we have the chance of our
lives to put men on the land. Because this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
still a Party question, to be sagaciously debated
up hill and down dale three or four years hence,
we shall very likely grasp the mere shadow and
miss the substance of that opportunity. If the
Government had a mandate "Full steam ahead"
we could add at the end of the war perhaps a
million men (potentially four million people) to
our food-growing country population; as it is, we
may add thereto a few thousands, lose half a
million to the Colonies, and discourage the rest&mdash;patting
our own backs the while. To put men on
the land we must have the land ready in terms of
earth, not of paper; and have it in the right places,
within easy reach of town or village. Things can
be done just now. We know, for instance, that
in a few months half a million allotment-gardens
have been created in urban areas and more progress
made with small holdings than in previous
years. I repeat, we have a chance which will not
recur to scotch the food danger, and to restore a
healthier balance between town and country
stocks. Shall we be penny-wise and lose this
chance for the luxury of "free and full discussion
of a controversial matter at a time when men's
minds are not full of the country's danger"?
This <i>is</i> the country's danger&mdash;there is no other.
And this is the moment for full and free discussion
of it, for full and free action too. Who doubts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
that a Government which brought this question
of the land in its widest aspects to the touch-stone
of full debate at once, would get its mandate,
would get the power it wanted&mdash;not to
gerrymander, but to build?</p>

<p>Consider the Corn Production Bill. I will
quote Mr. Prothero: "National security is not an
impracticable dream. It is within our reach,
within the course of a few years, and it involves
no great dislocation of other industries." (Note
that.) "For all practical purposes, if we could
grow at home here 82 per cent, of all the food that
we require for five years, we should be safe, and
that amount of independence of sea-borne supplies
we can secure, and secure within a few
years.... We could obtain that result if we
could add 8,000,000 acres of arable land to our
existing area&mdash;that is to say, if we increased it
from 19,000,000 acres to 27,000,000 acres. If you
once got that extension of your arable area, the
nation would be safe from the nightmare of a
submarine menace, and the number of additional
men who would be required on the land would be
something about a quarter of a million." (Note
that.) "The present Bill is much less ambitious."
It is. And it is introduced by one who
knows and dreads, as much as any of us, the
dangerous and unballasted condition into which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
we have drifted; introduced with, as it were,
apology, as if he feared that, unambitious though,
it be, it will startle the nerves of Parliament. On
a question so vast and vital you are bound to
startle by any little measure. Nothing but an
heroic measure would arouse debate on a scale
adequate to reach and stir the depths of our national
condition, and wake us all, politicians and
public, to appreciate the fact that our whole
future is in this matter, and that it must be
tackled.</p>

<p>If we are not capable now of grasping the vital
nature of this issue we assuredly never shall be.
Only five generations have brought us to the
parasitic, town-ridden condition we are in. The
rate of progress in deterioration will increase
rapidly with each coming generation. We have,
as it were, turned seven-ninths of our population
out into poor paddocks, to breed promiscuously
among themselves. We have the chance to make
our English and Welsh figures read: Twenty-four
millions of town-dwellers to twelve of country,
instead of, as now, twenty-eight millions to eight.
Consider what that would mean to the breeding
of the next generation. In such extra millions of
country stock our national hope lies. What we
should never dream of permitting with our domestic
animals, we are not only permitting but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
encouraging among ourselves; we are doing all we
can to perpetuate and increase poor stock; stock
without either quality or bone, run-down, and
ill-shaped. And, just as the progress in the
"stock" danger is accelerated with each generation,
so does the danger from outside increase with
every year which sees flying and submarining
improve, and our food capacity standing still.</p>

<p>The great argument against a united effort to
regain our ballast is: We must not take away too
many from our vital industries. Why, even the
Minister of Agriculture, who really knows and
dreads the danger, almost apologises for taking
two hundred and fifty thousand from those vital
industries, to carry out, not his immediate, but
his ideal, programme. Vital industries! Ah!
vital to Britain's destruction within the next few
generations unless we mend our ways! The
great impediment is the force of things as they
are, the huge vested interests, the iron network
of vast enterprises frightened of losing profit.
If we pass this moment, when men of every class
and occupation, even those who most thrive on
our town-ridden state, are a little frightened; if
we let slip this chance for a real reversal&mdash;can we
hope that anything considerable will be done,
with the dice loaded as they are, the scales
weighted so hopelessly in favour of the towns?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
Representatives of seven-ninths will always see
that representatives of two-ninths do not outvote
them. This is a crude way of putting it, but it
serves; because, after all, an elector is only a little
bundle of the immediate needs of his locality
and mode of life, outside of which he cannot see,
and which he does not want prejudiced. He is
not a fool, like me, looking into the future. And
his representatives have got to serve him. The
only chance, in a question so huge, vital, and <i>long</i>
as this, is that greatly distrusted agent&mdash;Panic
Legislation. When panic makes men, for a brief
space, open their eyes and see truth, then it is
valuable. Before our eyes close again and see
nothing but the darkness of the daily struggle
for existence, let us take advantage, and lay
foundations which will be difficult, at least, to
overturn.</p>

<p>What has been done so far, and what more can
be done? A bounty on corn has been introduced.
I suppose nobody, certainly not its promoter, is
enamoured of this. But it does not seem to have
occurred to every one that you cannot eat nuts
without breaking their shells, or get out of evil
courses without a transition period of extreme
annoyance to yourself. "Bounty" is, in many
quarters, looked on as a piece of petting to an
interest already pampered. Well&mdash;while we look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
on the land as an "interest" in competition with
other "interests" and not as <i>the</i> vital interest of
the country, underlying every other, so long shall
we continue to be "in the soup." The land needs
fostering, and again fostering, because the whole
vicious tendency of the country's life has brought
farming to its present pass and farmers to their
attitude of mistrust. Doctrinaire objections are
now ridiculous. An economic basis must be re-established,
or we may as well cry "Kamerad"
at once and hold up our hands to Fate. The
greater the arable acreage in this country, the
less will be the necessity for a bounty on corn.
Unlike most stimulants, it is one which gradually
stimulates away the need for it. With every
year and every million acres broken up, not only
will the need for bounty diminish, but the present
mistrustful breed of farmer will be a step nearer
to extinction. Shrewd, naturally conservative,
and somewhat intolerant of anything so dreamy
as a national point of view, they will not live for
ever. The up-growing farmer will not be like
them, and about the time the need for bounty
is vanishing the new farmer will be in possession.
But in the meantime land must be broken
up until 8,000,000 acres at least are conquered;
and bounty is the only lever. It will not be
lever enough without constant urging. In Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
Prothero's history of English farming occur these
words: "A Norfolk farmer migrated to Devonshire
in 1780, where he drilled and hoed his roots;
though his crops were far superior to those of
other farmers in the district, yet at the close of
the century no neighbour had followed his example."</p>

<p>But even the break-up of 8,000,000 acres,
though it may make us safe for food, will only
increase our country population by 250,000 labourers
and their families (a million souls)&mdash;a
mere beginning towards the satisfaction of our
need. We want in operation, before demobilisation
begins, a great national plan for the creation
of good small holdings run on co-operative lines.
And to this end, why should not the suggestion of
tithe redemption, thrown out by Mr. Prothero,
on pages 399 and 400 of "English Farming: Past
and Present," be adopted? The annual value of
tithes is about £5,000,000. Their extinction
should provide the Government with about 2,500,000
acres, enough at one stroke to put three
or four hundred thousand soldiers on the land.
The tithe-holders would get their money, landlords
would not be prejudiced; the Government,
by virtue of judicious choice and discretionary
compulsion, would obtain the sort of land it
wanted, and the land would be for ever free of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
teasing and vexatious charge. The cost to the
Government would be £100,000,000 (perhaps
more) on the best security it could have. "Present
conditions," I quote from the book, "are
favourable to such a transaction. The price of
land enables owners to extinguish the rent charge
by the surrender of a reasonable acreage, and the
low price of Consols enables investors to obtain
a larger interest for their money." For those not
familiar with this notion, the process, in brief, is
this: The Government pays the tithe-holder the
capitalised value of his tithe, and takes over from
the landlord as much land as produces in net annual
rent the amount of the tithe-rent charge,
leaving the rest of his land tithe-free for ever.
There are doubtless difficulties and objections,
but so there must be to any comprehensive plan
for obtaining an amount of land at all adequate.
Time is of desperate importance in this matter.
It is already dangerously late, but if the Government
would turn-to now with a will, the situation
could still be saved, and this unique chance
for re-stocking our countryside would not be
thrown away.</p>

<p>I alluded to the formation within a few months
of half a million garden-allotments&mdash;plots of
ground averaging about ten poles each, taken
under the Defence of the Realm Act from building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
and other land in urban areas, and given to
cultivators, under a guarantee, for the growth of
vegetables. This most valuable effort, for which
the Board of Agriculture deserves the thanks of
all, is surely capable of very great extension.
Every town, no matter how quickly it may be
developing, is always surrounded by a belt of
dubious land&mdash;not quite town and not quite
country. When town development mops up plots
in cultivation, a hole can be let out in an elastic
belt which is capable of almost indefinite expansion.
But this most useful and health-giving work
has only been possible under powers which will
cease when the immediate danger to the State
has passed. If a movement, which greatly augments
our home-grown food supply and can give
quiet, healthy, open-air, interesting work for
several hours a week to perhaps a million out of
our congested town populations&mdash;if such a movement
be allowed to collapse at the coming of
peace, it will be nothing less than criminal. I
plead here that the real danger to the State will
not pass but rather begin, with the signing of
peace, that the powers to acquire and grant these
garden-allotments should be continued, and every
effort made to foster and <i>extend</i> the movement.
Considering that, whatever we do to re-colonise
our land, we must still have in this country a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
dangerously huge town population, this kitchen-garden
movement can be of incalculable value in
combating town-blight, in securing just that air to
lungs and mind, and just that spice of earth reality
which all town-dwellers need so much.</p>

<p>Extension of arable land by at least 8,000,000
acres; creation of hundreds of thousands of small
holdings by tithe redemption, or another scheme
still in the blue; increase and perpetuation of garden-allotments&mdash;besides
all these we want, of
course, agricultural schools and facilities for training;
<i>co-operatively organised finance, transport, and
marketing of produce</i>; for without schooling, and
co-operation, no system of small holding on a
large scale can possibly succeed. We now have
the labourer's minimum wage, which, I think,
will want increasing; but we want good rural
housing on an economically sound basis, an enlivened
village life, and all that can be done to
give the worker on the land a feeling that he can
rise, the sense that he is not a mere herd, at the
beck and call of what has been dubbed the "tyranny
of the countryside." The land gives work
which is varied, alive, and interesting beyond all
town industries, save those, perhaps, of art and
the highly-skilled crafts and professions. If we
can once get land-life back on to a wide and solid
basis, it should hold its own.</p>

<p>Dare any say that this whole vast question of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
the land, with its throbbing importance, yea&mdash;seeing
that demobilisations do not come every
year&mdash;its desperately immediate importance, is
not fit matter for instant debate and action; dare
any say that we ought to relegate it to that limbo
"After the war"? In grim reality it takes precedence
of every other question. It is infinitely
more vital to our safety and our health than consideration
of our future commercial arrangements.
In our present Parliament&mdash;practically,
if not sentimentally speaking&mdash;all shades of opinion
are as well represented as they are likely to
be in future Parliaments&mdash;even the interests of
our women and our soldiers; to put off the good
day when this question is threshed out, is to crane
at an imagined hedge.</p>

<p>Let us know now at what we are aiming, let us
admit and record in the black and white of legislation
that we intend to trim our course once more
for the port of health and safety. If this Britain
of ours is going to pin her whole future to a blind
pursuit of wealth, without considering whether
that wealth is making us all healthier and happier,
many of us, like Sancho, would rather retire at
once, and be made "governors of islands." For
who can want part or lot on a ship which goes
yawing with every sail set into the dark, without
rudder, compass, or lighted star?</p>

<p>I, for one, want a Britain who refuses to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
the mere immediate line of least resistance, who
knows and sets her course, and that a worthy one.
So do we all, I believe, at heart&mdash;only, the current
is so mighty and strong, and we are so used to it!</p>

<p>By the parasitic and town-ridden condition we
are in now, and in which without great and immediate
effort we are likely to remain, we degrade
our patriotism. That we should have to
tremble lest we be starved is a miserable, a
humiliating thought. To have had so little pride
and independence of spirit as to have come to
this, to have been such gobblers at wealth&mdash;who
dare defend it? We have made our bed; let us,
now, refuse to lie thereon. Better the floor than
this dingy feather couch of suffocation.</p>

<p>Our country is dear to us, and many are dying
for her. There can be no consecration of their
memory so deep or so true as this regeneration of
The Land.</p>

<h2>THE LAND, 1918</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY</h3>

<p>Can one assume that the pinch of this war is
really bringing home to us the vital need of growing
our own food henceforth? I do not think so.
Is there any serious shame felt at our parasitic
condition? None. Are we in earnest about the
resettlement of the land? Not yet.</p>

<p>All our history shows us to be a practical people
with short views. "<i>Tiens! Une montagne!</i>"
Never was a better summing up of British character
than those words of the French cartoonist
during the Boer War, beneath his picture of a
certain British General of those days, riding at a
hand gallop till his head was butting a cliff.
Without seeing a hand's breadth before our noses
we have built our Empire, our towns, our law.
We are born empiricists, and must have our faces
ground by hard facts, before we attempt to wriggle
past them. We have thriven so far, but the
ruin of England is likely to be the work of practical
men who burn the house down to roast the
pig, because they cannot see beyond the next
meal. Visions are airy; but I propose to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
visions for a moment, and Britain as she <i>might</i>
be in 1948.</p>

<p>I see our towns, not indeed diminished from
their present size, but no larger; much cleaner,
and surrounded by wide belts of garden allotments,
wherein town workers spend many of their
leisure hours. I see in Great Britain fifty millions
instead of forty-one; but the town population
only thirty-two millions as now, and the rural
population eighteen millions instead of the present
nine. I see the land farmed in three ways: very
large farms growing corn and milk, meat and
wool, or sugar beet; small farms <i>co-operatively run</i>
growing everything; and large groups of co-operative
small holdings, growing vegetables, fruit, pigs,
poultry, and dairy produce to some extent. There
are no game laws to speak of, and certainly no
large areas of ground cut to waste for private
whims. I see very decent cottages everywhere,
with large plots of ground at economic rents, and
decently waged people paying them; no tithes,
but a band of extinguished tithe-holders, happy
with their compensation. The main waterways
of the country seem joined by wide canals, and
along these canals factories are spread out on
the garden city plan, with allotments for the
factory workers. Along better roads run long
chains of small holdings, so that the co-operated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
holders have no difficulty in marketing their produce.
I see motor transport; tractor ploughs; improved
farm machinery; forestry properly looked
after, and foreshores reclaimed; each village owning
its recreation hall, with stage and cinema attached;
and public-houses run only on the principle
of no commission on the drink sold; every
school teaching the truth that happiness and
health, not mere money and learning, are the
prizes of life and the objects of education, and
for ever impressing on the scholars that life in the
open air and pleasure in their work are the two
chief secrets of health and happiness. In every
district a model farm radiates scientific knowledge
of the art of husbandry, bringing instruction
to each individual farmer, and leaving him no
excuse for ignorance. The land produces what it
ought; not, as now, feeding with each hundred
acres only fifty persons, while a German hundred
acres, not nearly so favoured by Nature, feeds
seventy-five. Every little girl has been taught
to cook. Farmers are no longer fearful of bankruptcy,
as in the years from 1875 to 1897, but
hold their own with all comers, proud of their
industry, the spine and marrow of a country which
respects itself once more. There seems no longer
jealousy or division between town and country;
and statesmen by tacit consent leave the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
free from Party politics. I see taller and stronger
men and women, rosier and happier children; a
race no longer narrow, squashed, and disproportionate;
no longer smoke-dried and nerve-racked,
with the driven, don't-care look of a town-ridden
land. And surely the words "Old England" are
spoken by all voices with a new affection, as of a
land no longer sucking its sustenance from other
lands, but sound and sweet, the worthy heart
once more of a great commonwealth of countries.</p>

<p>All this I seem to see, if certain things are done
now and persevered in hereafter. But let none
think that we can restore self-respect and the
land-spirit to this country under the mere momentary
pressure of our present-day need. Such
a transformation cannot come unless we are
genuinely ashamed that Britain should be a
sponge; unless we truly wish to make her again
sound metal, ringing true, instead of a splay-footed
creature, dependent for vital nourishment
on oversea supplies&mdash;a cockshy for every foe.</p>

<p>We are practically secured by Nature, yet have
thrown security to the winds because we cannot
feed ourselves! We have as good a climate and
soil as any in the world, not indeed for pleasure,
but for health and food, and yet, I am sure, we
are rotting physically faster than any other people!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
Let the nation put that reflection in its pipe
and smoke it day by day; for only so shall we
emerge from a bad dream and seize again on our
birthright.</p>

<p>Let us dream a little of what we might become.
Let us not crawl on with our stomachs to the
ground, and not an ounce of vision in our heads
for fear lest we be called visionaries. And let us
rid our minds of one or two noxious superstitions.
It is not true that country life need mean dull
and cloddish life; it has in the past, because agriculture
as been neglected for the false glamour
of the towns, and village life left to seed down.
There is no real reason why the villager should
not have all he needs of social life and sane amusement;
village life only wants organising. It is
not true that country folk must be worse fed and
worse plenished than town folk. This has only
been so sometimes because a starved industry
which was losing hope has paid starvation wages.
It is not true that our soil and climate are of indifferent
value for the growth of wheat. The
contrary is the case. "The fact which has been
lost sight of in the past twenty years must be insisted
on nowadays, that England is naturally one
of the best, if not the very best wheat-growing
country in the world. Its climate and soil are almost
ideal for the production of the heaviest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
crops": Professor R. H. Biffen. "The view of
leading German agriculturists is that their soils
and climate are distinctly inferior to those of
Britain": Mr. T. H. Middleton, Assistant Secretary
to the Board of Agriculture.</p>

<p>We have many mouths in this country, but no
real excuse for not growing the wherewithal to
feed them.</p>

<p>To break the chains of our lethargy and superstitions,
let us keep before us a thought and a
vision&mdash;the thought that, since the air is mastered
and there are pathways under the sea, we, the
proudest people in the world, will exist henceforth
by mere merciful accident, <i>until we grow our
own food</i>; and the vision of ourselves as a finer
race in body and mind than we have ever yet
been. And then let us be practical by all means;
for in the practical measures of the present,
spurred on by that thought, inspired by that
vision, alone lies the hope and safety of the future.</p>

<p>What are those measures?</p>


<h3>
<br />
II</h3>

<h3>WHEAT</h3>

<p>The measure which underlies all else is the
ploughing up of permanent grass&mdash;the reconversion
of land which was once arable, the addition to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
arable of land which has never been arable, so as
to secure the only possible basis of success&mdash;the
wheat basis.</p>

<p>I have before me a Report on the Breaking up
of Grass Land in fifty-five counties for the winter
of 1916&ndash;1917, which shows four successes for every
failure. The Report says: "It has been argued
during the past few months that it is hopeless
to attempt to plough out old grass land in
the expectation of adding to the nation's food.
The experience of 1917 does not support this contention.
It shows not only that the successes far
outnumber the failures, but that the latter are to
some extent preventable."</p>

<p>The Government's 1918 tillage programme for
England and Wales was to increase (as compared
with 1916), (1) the area under corn by 2,600,000
acres, (2) the area under potatoes and mangolds
by 400,000 acres, (3) the arable land by 2,000,000
acres. I have it on the best authority that the
Government hopes to better this in the forth-coming
harvest. That shows what our farmers
can do with their backs to the wall. It sometimes
happens in this world that we act virtuously
without in any way believing that virtue is its
own reward. Most of our farmers are hoeing
their rows in this crisis in the full belief that they
are serving the country to the hurt of their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
interests; they will not, I imagine, realise that
they are laying the foundations of a future prosperity
beyond their happiest dreams until the
crisis is long past. All the more credit to them
for a great effort. They by no means grasp at
present the fact that with every acre they add to
arable, with each additional acre of wheat, they
increase their own importance and stability, and
set the snowball of permanent prosperity in their
industry rolling anew. Pasture was a policy
adopted by men who felt defeat in their bones,
saw bankruptcy round every corner. Those who
best know seem agreed that after the war the
price of wheat will not come down with a run.
The world shortage of food and shipping will be
very great, and the "new world's" surplus will
be small. Let our farmers take their courage in
their hands, play a bold game, and back their
own horse for the next four or five seasons, and
they will, <i>if supported by the country</i>, be in a
position once more to defy competition. Let
them have faith and go for the gloves and they
will end by living without fear of the new worlds.
"There is a tide in the affairs of men." This is
the British farmer's tide, which, taken at the
flood, leads on to fortune. But only if the British
farmer intends that Britain shall feed herself;
only if he farms the land of Britain so that acre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
by acre it yields the maximum of food. A hundred
acres under potatoes feeds 420 persons; a
hundred acres under wheat feeds 200 persons; a
hundred acres of grass feeds fifteen persons. It
requires no expert to see that the last is the losing
horse; for increase of arable means also increase
of winter food, and in the long run increase,
not decrease, of live stock. In Denmark (1912)
arable was to permanent grass as about 4 to 5; in
the United Kingdom it was only as about 5 to 7.
Yet in Denmark there were five cattle to every
eight acres of grass, and in the United Kingdom
only four cattle to every nine acres.</p>

<p>Let me quote Professor Biffen on the prospects
of wheat: "In the United States the amount exported
tends to fall. The results are so marked
that we find American agricultural experts seriously
considering the possibility of the United
States having to become a wheat importing country
in order to feed the rapidly growing population."
When she does, that wheat will come from
Canada; and "there are several other facts which
lead one to question the statement so frequently
made that Canada will shortly be the Empire's
granary...." He thinks that the Argentine
(which trebles her population every forty years)
is an uncertain source; that Russia, where the
population also increases with extreme rapidity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
is still more uncertain; that neither India nor
Australia are dependable fields of supply. "The
world's crop continues to increase slowly, and
concurrently the number of wheat consumers increases....
Prices have tended to rise of late
years, a fact which may indicate that the world's
consumption is increasing faster than its rate of
production. There are now no vast areas of land
comparable with those of North and South America
awaiting the pioneer wheat growers, and consequently
<i>there is no likelihood of any repetition of
the over-production characteristic of the period of
1874&ndash;1894</i>....</p>

<p>"If as there is every reason to hope the problem
of breeding satisfactory strong wheats" (for this
country) "has been solved, then their cultivation
should add about £1 to the value of the produce
of every acre of wheat in the country....</p>

<p>"At a rough estimate the careful use of artificials
might increase the average yield of the acre
from four quarters up to five....</p>

<p>"England is one of the best, if not the very
best wheat-growing country in the world."</p>

<p>That, shortly, is the wheat position for this
country in the view of our most brilliant practical
expert. I commend it to the notice of those
who are faint-hearted about the future of wheat
in Britain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
With these prospects and possibilities before
him, <i>and a fair price for wheat guaranteed him</i>, is
the British farmer going to let down the land to
grass again when the war is over? The fair price
for wheat will be the point on which his decision
will turn. When things have settled down after
the war, the fair price will be that at which the
<i>average</i> farmer can profitably grow wheat, and
such a price must be maintained&mdash;by bounty, if
necessary. It never can be too often urged on
politicians and electorate that they, who thwart a
policy which makes wheat-growing firm and
profitable, are knocking nails in the coffin of their
country. We are no longer, and never shall again
be, an island. The air is henceforth as simple an
avenue of approach as Piccadilly is to Leicester
Square. If we are ever attacked there will be no
time to get our second wind, unless we can feed
ourselves. And since we are constitutionally
liable to be caught napping, we shall infallibly
be brought to the German heel next time, if we
are not self-supporting. But if we are, there will
be no next time. An attempt on us will not be
worth the cost. Further, we are running to seed
physically from too much town-life and the failure
of country stocks; we shall never stem that
rot unless we re-establish agriculture on a large
scale. To do that, in the view of nearly all who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
have thought this matter out, we must found our
farming on wheat; grow four-fifths instead of one-fifth
of our supply, and all else will follow.</p>

<p>In England and Wales 11,246,106 acres were
arable land in 1917, and 15,835,375 permanent
grass land. To reverse these figures, at least, is
the condition of security, perhaps even of existence
in the present and the only guarantee of a
decent and safe future.</p>


<h3>
<br />
III</h3>

<h3>HOLDINGS</h3>

<p>One expert pins faith to large farms; another to
small holdings. How agreeable to think that
both are right. We cannot afford to neglect any
type of holding; all must be developed and supported,
for all serve vital purposes. For instance,
the great development of small holdings in Germany
is mainly responsible for the plentiful supply
of labour on the land there; "until measures
can be devised for greatly increasing the area
under holdings of less than 100 acres in Britain
we are not likely to breed and maintain in the
country a sufficient number of that class of
worker which will be required if we are greatly
to extend our arable land": Mr. T. H. Middleton,
Assistant Secretary to the Board of Agriculture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
But I am not going into the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i>
of the holdings question. I desire rather to point
out here that a moment is approaching, which
will never come again, for the resettling of the
land.</p>

<p>A rough census taken in 1916 among our soldiers
gave the astounding figure of 750,000 desirous
of going on the land. That figure will
shrink to a mere skeleton unless on demobilisation
the Government is ready with a comprehensive
plan. The men fall roughly into two classes: those
who were already on the land; those who were not.
The first will want to go back to their own districts,
but not to the cottages and wages they
had before the war. For them, it is essential to
provide new cottages with larger gardens, otherwise
they will go to the Dominions, to America,
or to the towns. A fresh census should be taken
and kept up to date, the wants of each man
noted, and a definite attempt made now to earmark
sites and material for building, to provide
the garden plots, and plan the best and prettiest
type of cottage. For lack of labour and material
no substantial progress can be made with housing
while the war is on, but if a man can see his
cottage and his ground ready, in the air, he will
wait; if he cannot, he will be off, and we shall
have lost him. Wages are not to fall again below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
twenty-five shillings, and will probably stay at a
considerably higher level. The cottage and the
garden ground for these men will be the determining
factor, and that garden ground should be
at least an acre. A larger class by far will be
men who were not on the land, but having tasted
open-air life, think they wish to continue it. A
fresh census of this class and their wants should
be taken also. It will subdivide them into men
who want the life of independent medium and
small holders, with from 100 to 20 acres of land,
and men who with 5 or 10 acres of their own are
willing to supplement their living by seasonal
work on the large farms. For all a cut-and-dried
scheme providing land and homes is absolutely
essential. If they cannot be assured of having
these within a few months of their return to civil
life, they will go either to the Dominions or back
to the towns. One of them, I am told, thus
forecasts their future wants: "When we're free
we shall have a big spree in the town; we shall
then take the first job that comes along; if it's
an indoor job we shan't be able to stick it and
shall want to get on the land." I am pretty sure
he's wrong. He will want his spree, of course;
but <i>if he is allowed to go back to a town job</i> he is
not at all likely to leave it again. Men so soon
get used to things, and the towns have a fierce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
grip. For this second class, no less than the
first, it is vital to have the land ready, and the
cottages estimated for. I think men of both
these classes, when free, should be set at once to
the building of their own homes and the preparation
of their land. I think huts ought to be ready
for them and their wives till their homes are
habitable. A man who takes a hand in the
building of his house, and the first work on his
new holding, is far less likely to abandon his idea
of settling on the land than a man who is simply
dumped into a ready-made concern. That is
human nature. Let him begin at the beginning,
and while his house is going up be assisted and
instructed. Frankly, I am afraid that in the
difficulty of fixing on an ideal scheme and ideal
ways of working it, we shall forget that the moment
of demobilisation is unique. Any scheme,
however rough and ready, which will fix men or
their intention of settling on the land in Britain
at the moment of demobilisation will be worth a
hundred better-laid plans which have waited for
perfection till that one precious moment is overpast.
While doctors quarrel, or lay their heads
together, the patient dies.</p>

<p>The Government, I understand, have adopted
a scheme by which they can secure land. If they
have not ascertained from these men what land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
they will want, and secured that land by the time
the men are ready, that scheme will be of little
use to them.</p>

<p>The Government, I gather, have decided on a
huge scheme for urban and rural housing. About
that I have this to say. The rural housing ought
to take precedence of the urban, not because it is
more intrinsically necessary, but because if the
moment of demobilisation is let slip for want of
rural cottages, we shall lose our very life blood,
our future safety, perhaps our existence as a
nation. We must seize on this one precious
chance of restoring the land and guaranteeing
our future. The towns can wait a little for their
housing, the country cannot. It is a sort of test
question for our leaders in every Party. Surely
they will rise to the vital necessity of grasping
this chance! If, when the danger of starvation
has been staring us hourly in the face for years
on end, and we have for once men in hundreds of
thousands waiting and hoping to be settled on
the land, to give us the safety of the future&mdash;if,
in such circumstances, we cannot agree to make
the most of that chance, it will show such lack of
vision that I really feel we may as well throw up
the sponge. If jealousy by towns of country can
so blind public opinion to our danger and our
chance, so that no precedence can be given to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
rural needs, well, then, frankly we are not fit to
live as a nation.</p>

<p>I am told that Germany has seen to this matter.
She does not mean to be starved in the
future; she intends to keep the backbone of her
country sound. She, who already grew 80 per
cent. of her food, will grow it all. She, who already
appreciated the dangers of a rampant
industrialism, will take no further risks with the
physique of her population. We who did not
grow one-half of our food, and whose riotous industrialism
has made far greater inroads on our
physique; we who, though we have not yet suffered
the privations of Germany, have been in
far more real danger&mdash;we shall talk about it, say
how grave the situation is, how "profoundly" we
are impressed by the need to feed ourselves&mdash;and
we shall act, I am very much afraid, too late.</p>

<p>There are times when the proverb: "Act in
haste and repent at leisure" should be written
"Unless you act in haste you will repent at leisure."
This is such a time. We can take, of
course, the right steps or the wrong steps to settle
our soldiers on the land; but no wrong step
we can take will be so utterly wrong as to let the
moment of demobilisation slip. We have a good
and zealous Minister of Agriculture, we have
good men alive to the necessity, working on this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
job. If we miss the chance it will be because
"interests" purblind, selfish and perverse, and a
lethargic public opinion, do not back them; because
we want to talk it out; because trade and
industry think themselves of superior importance
to the land. Henceforth trade and industry are
of secondary importance in this country. There
is only one thing of absolutely vital importance,
and that is agriculture.</p>

<h3>INSTRUCTION</h3>

<p>I who have lived most of my time on a farm for
many years, in daily contact with farmer and
labourer, do really appreciate what variety and
depth of knowledge is wanted for good farming.
It is a lesson to the armchair reformer to watch a
farmer walking across the "home meadow"
whence he can see a good way over his land.
One can feel the slow wisdom working in his head.
A halt, a look this way and that, a whistle, the
call of some instruction so vernacular that only a
native could understand; the contemplation of
sheep, beasts, sky, crops; always something being
noted, and shrewd deductions made therefrom.
It is a great art, and, like all art, to be
learned only with the sweat of the brow and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
long, minute attention to innumerable details.
You cannot play at farming, and you cannot
"mug it up." One understands the contempt of
the farmer born and bred for the book-skilled
gentleman who tries to instruct his grandmother
in the sucking of eggs. The farmer's knowledge,
acquired through years of dumb wrestling with
Nature, in his own particular corner, is his strength
and&mdash;his weakness. Vision of the land at large,
of its potentialities, and its needs is almost of
necessity excluded. The practical farmers of our
generation might well be likened unto sailing-ship
seamen in an age when it has suddenly become
needful to carry commerce by steam. They are
pupils of the stern taskmaster bankruptcy; the
children of the years from 1874&ndash;1897, when the
nation had turned its thumb down on British
farmers, and left them to fight, unaided, against
extinction. They have been brought up to carry
on against contrary winds and save themselves
as best they could. Well, they have done it; and
now they are being asked to reverse their processes
in the interests of a country which left them
in the lurch. Naturally they are not yet persuaded
that the country will not leave them in the
lurch again.</p>

<p>Instruction of the British farmer begins with
the fortification of his will by confidence. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
you ask him to plough up grass land, to revise
the rotation of his crops, to grow wheat, to use
new brands of corn, to plough with tractors, and
to co-operate, you are asking a man deeply and
deservedly cynical about your intentions and
your knowledge. He has seen wheat fail all his
life, he has seen grass succeed. Grass has saved
him, and now he is asked to turn his back on it.
Little wonder that he curses you for a meddling
fool. "Prove it!" he says&mdash;and you cannot. You
could if you had it in your power to show him
that your guarantee of a fair price for wheat was
"good as the Bank." Thus, the first item of instruction
to the farmer consists in the definite
alteration of public opinion towards the land by
adoption of the <i>sine quâ non</i> that in future we will
feed ourselves. The majority of our farmers do
not think their interests are being served by the
present revolution of farming. Patriotic fear for
the country, and dread of D.O.R.A.&mdash;not quite
the same thing&mdash;are driving them on. Besides, it
is the townsmen of Britain, <i>not the farmers</i>, who
are in danger of starvation, not merely now, but
henceforth for evermore until we feed ourselves.
If starvation really knocked at our doors, the only
houses it would not enter would be the houses of
those who grow food. The farmers in Germany
are all right; they would be all right here. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
townsmen of this country were entirely responsible
for our present condition, and the very least
they can do is to support their own salvation.
But while with one corner of their mouths the
towns are now shouting: "Grow food! Feed us,
please!" with the other they are still inclined to
add: "You pampered industry!" Alas! we cannot
have it both ways.</p>

<p>The second point I want to make about instruction
is the importance of youth. In America,
where they contemplate a labour shortage of
2,000,000 men on their farms, they are using boys
from sixteen to twenty-one, when their military
age begins. Can we not do the same here? Most
of our boys from fifteen to eighteen are now on
other work. But the work they are doing could
surely be done by girls or women. If we could
put even a couple of hundred thousand boys of
that age on the land it would be the solution of
our present agricultural labour shortage, and the
very best thing that could happen for the future
of farming. The boys would learn at first hand;
they would learn slowly and thoroughly; and
many of them would stay on the land. They
might be given specialised schooling in agriculture,
the most important schooling we can give
our rising generation, while all of them would
gain physically. By employing women on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
land, where we can employ boys of from fifteen
to eighteen, we are blind-alleying. Women will
not stay on the land in any numbers; few will
wish that they should. Boys will, and every one
would wish that they may.</p>

<p>The third point I want to make concerns the
model farm. If we are to have resettlement on
any large scale and base our farming on crops in
future, the accessibility of the best practical advice
is an absolute essential.</p>

<p>Till reformed education begins to take effect,
the advice and aid of "model" farmers should be
available in every district. Some recognised diploma
might with advantage be given to farmers
for outstanding merit and enterprise. No instruction
provided from our advisory agricultural
councils or colleges can have as much prestige
and use in any district as the advice of the
leading farmer who had been crowned as a successful
expert. It is ever well in this country to
take advantage of the competitive spirit which
lies deep in the bones of our race. To give the
best farmers a position and prestige to which
other farmers can aspire would speed up effort
everywhere. We want more competition in actual
husbandry and less competition in matters
of purchase and sale. And that brings us to the
vital question of co-operation.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>
<h3>
<br />

<h3>CO-OPERATION (SMALL HOLDINGS)</h3>

<p>"The most important economic question for all
nations in the past has been, and in the future
will be, the question of a sufficient food supply,
independent of imports.</p>

<p>"It is doubtful whether the replacement of
German agriculture on a sound basis in the last
ten years is to be ascribed in a greater measure
to technical advance in agricultural methods, or
to the development of the co-operative system.
Perhaps it would be right to say that for the
large farms it is due to the first, and for the smaller
farms (three quarters of the arable land in Germany)
to the second. <i>For it is only through
co-operation that the advantages of farming on a
large scale are made possible for smaller farmers.</i>
The more important of those advantages are the
regulated purchase of all raw materials and half-finished
products (artificial manures, feeding stuffs,
seeds, etc.), better prices for products, facilities
for making use, in moderation, of personal credit
at a cheap rate of interest, together with the
possibility of saving and putting aside small sums
of interest; all these advantages of the large farmer
have been placed within the reach of the small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
farmers by local co-operative societies for buying,
selling, and farming co-operatively, as well as
by saving and other banks, all connected to central
associations and central co-operative societies.</p>

<p>"<i>Over two million small farmers are organised in
Germany on co-operative lines.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p>Nearly two million small farmers co-operated
in Germany; and here-how many? The Registrar
returns the numbers for 1916 at 1,427 small
holders.</p>

<p>In the view of all authorities co-operation is
essential for the success of small farmers and
small holders; but it needs no brilliant intellect,
nor any sweep of the imagination to see a truth
plainer than the nose on a man's face.</p>

<p>"There is some reason to hope," says Mr.
Middleton, "that after the war agriculturalists
will show a greater disposition to co-operate; but
we cannot expect co-operation to do as much
for British agriculture as it has done for the
Germans, who so readily join societies and support
co-operative efforts."</p>

<p>So much the worse for us!</p>

<p>The Agricultural Organisation Society, the officially
recognised agency for fostering the co-operative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
principle, has recently formed an Agricultural
Wholesale Society with a large subscribed
capital, for the purchase of all farming requirements,
and the marketing of produce, to be at
the disposal of all co-operated farmers, small
holders, and allotment holders, whose societies
are affiliated to the Agricultural Organisation.
Society. This is a step of infinite promise. The
drawing together of these three classes of workers
on the land is in itself a matter of great importance.
One of the chief complaints of small holders
in the past has been that large holders regard
them askance. The same, perhaps, applies to
the attitude of the small holder to the allotment
holder. That is all bad. Men and women on
the land should be one big family, with interests,
and sympathies in common and a neighbourly
feeling.</p>

<p>A leaflet of the Agricultural Organisation Society
thus describes a certain co-operative small
holdings' society with seventeen members renting
ninety acres. "It owns a team of horses, cart,
horse-hoe, plough, ridger, harrow, Cambridge
roller, marker; and hires other implements as
required; it insures, buys, and sells co-operatively.
This year (for patriotic reasons) wheat and potatoes
form the chief crop, with sufficient oats,
barley, beans and mangolds to feed the horses and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
the pigs, of which there are many. The society
last year marketed more fat pigs than the rest of
the village and adjoining farms put together.</p>

<p>"The land, on the whole, is undoubtedly better
cultivated and cropped, and <i>supports a far larger
head of population per acre than the neighbouring
large farms</i>." Even allowing that the first statement
may be disputed, the last is beyond dispute,
and is <i>the</i> important thing to bear in mind about
small holdings from the national point of view;
for every extra man and woman on the land is a
credit item in the bank book of the nation's future.</p>

<p>"In addition," says the leaflet, "there is a
friendly spirit prevalent among the members,
who are always willing to help each other, and
at harvest time combine to gather in the crops."</p>

<p>With more land, not only some, but all the
members of this little society could support
themselves entirely on their holdings. "The
members value their independence and freedom,
but recognise the value of combined action and
new ideas."</p>

<p>Now this is exactly what we want. For instance,
these members have found out that the
profit on potatoes when home-grown farmyard
manure alone was used was only 14<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per acre;
and that a suitable combination of artificial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
manures gave a profit of £14 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> an acre,
with double the yield. Mutual help and the
spread of knowledge; more men and women on
the land&mdash;this is the value of the agricultural co-operative
movement, whose importance to this
country it is impossible to over-estimate.</p>

<p>From letters of small holders I take the following remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of course it's absolutely necessary that the
prospective small holder should have a thorough
knowledge of farming."</p>

<p>"In regard to implements, you need as many
of some sorts on a small holding as you do on a
large farm. A small man can't afford to buy all,
so he has to work at a disadvantage.... Then
as to seeds, why not buy them wholesale, and
sell them to the small holder, also manures, and
many other things which the small holder has to
pay through the nose for."</p>

<p>"Men with no actual knowledge of land work
would rarely succeed whatever financial backing
they might receive."</p>

<p>"About here small holdings are usually let to
men who have been tradesmen or pitmen, and
they of course cannot be expected to make the
most of them."</p>

<p>"When you restrict a farmer to 50 acres he
ought to be provided with ample and proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
buildings for every kind of stock he wishes to
keep."</p>

<p>These few remarks, which might be supplemented
<i>ad libitum</i>, illustrate the difficulties and
dangers which beset any large scheme of land
settlement by our returning soldiers and others.
Such a scheme is bound to fail unless it is based
most firmly on co-operation, for, without that,
the two absolute essentials&mdash;knowledge, with the
benefit of practical advice and help; and assistance
by way of co-operative finance, and co-operatively-owned
implements, will be lacking.</p>

<p>Set the returning soldier down on the land to
work it on his own and, whatever his good-will,
you present the countryside with failure. Place
at his back pooled labour, monetary help and
knowledge, and, above all, the spirit of mutual
aid, and you may, and I believe will, triumph over
difficulties, which are admittedly very great.</p>


<h3>
<br />
VI</h3>

<h3>CO-OPERATION (ALLOTMENTS)</h3>

<p>The growth of allotment gardens is a striking
feature of our agricultural development under
stimulus of the war. They say a million and a
half allotment gardens are now being worked on.
That is, no doubt, a papery figure; nor is it so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
much the number, as what is being done on them,
that matters. Romance may have "brought up
the nine-fifteen," but it will not bring up potatoes.
Still, these new allotments without doubt add
very greatly to our food supply, give hosts of our
town population healthy work in the open air, and
revive in them that "earth instinct" which was
in danger of being utterly lost. The spade is a
grand corrective of nerve strain, and the more
town and factory workers take up allotment gardens,
the better for each individual, and for us all
as a race.</p>

<p>They say nearly all the ground available round
our towns has already been utilised. But DORA,
in her wild career, may yet wring out another
hundred thousand acres. I wish her well in this
particular activity. And the Government she
serves with such devotion will betray her if, when
DORA is in her grave&mdash;consummation devoutly
to be wished&mdash;her work on allotment gardens is
not continued. There is always a ring of land
round a town, like a halo round the moon. As
the town's girth increases, so should that halo;
and even in time of peace, larger and larger, not
less and less, should grow the number of town
dwellers raising vegetables, fruit and flowers, resting
their nerves and expanding lungs and muscles
with healthy outdoor work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
"In no direction is the co-operative principle
more adaptable or more useful than in the matter
of Allotment Associations."</p>

<p>There are now allotment associations in many
parts of the country. One at Winchester has over
1,000 tenant members. And round the great
manufacturing towns many others have been
formed.</p>

<p>To illustrate the advantages of such co-operation,
let me quote a little from the Hon. Secretary
of the Urmston Allotments Association, near
Manchester: "Though the Urmston men had
foremost in their mind the aim of producing payable
crops ... they determined that their allotments
should be convenient and comfortable to
work, and pleasing to look upon.... It is a delusion
often found among novices that ordinary
ground takes a long time to get into decent order;
and is an expensive business. But enlightened
and energetic men <i>working together</i> can do wonderful
things. They did them at Urmston. The
ground was only broken up in March, 1916, but
in the same season splendid crops of peas, potatoes
and other vegetables were raised by the
holders, <i>the majority of whom had little or no
previous experience of gardening</i>.... So as to deal
with the main needs of the members co-operatively
in the most effective manner a Trading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
Committee was appointed to advise and make
contracts.... Manure, lime, salt, and artificial
manures have been ordered collectively; and seeds
and other gardening requisites arranged for at
liberal discounts."</p>

<p>Besides all this the association has fought the
potato wart disease; had its soil analyzed; educated
its members through literature and lectures;
made roads and fences; looked after the
appearance of its plots, and encouraged flower-growing.
Finally, a neighbourly feeling of friendly
emulation has grown up among its members.
And this is their conclusion: "The advantages of
co-operation are not confined to economy in time
and money, for the common interest that binds
all members to seek the success of the Association,
also provides the means of developing and
utilising the individual talents of the members
for communal and national purposes."</p>

<p>They speak, indeed, like a book, and every
word is true&mdash;which is not always the same thing.</p>

<p>The Agricultural Organization Society gives
every assistance in forming these associations;
and the more there are of them the greater will
be the output of food, the strength and knowledge
of the individual plot-holder, the stability of his
tenure, and the advantage of the nation.</p>

<p>Mistrust and reserve between workers on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
land, be they large farmers, small farmers, or
plotholders is the result of combining husbandry
with the habits and qualities of the salesman. If
a man's business is to get the better of his neighbours
on market days, it will be his pleasure to
doubt them on all other days.</p>

<p>The co-operative system, by conducting purchase
and sale impersonally, removes half the
reason and excuse for curmudgeonery, besides securing
better prices both at sale and purchase.
To the disgust of the cynic, moral and material
advantage here go hand in hand. Throughout
agriculture co-operation will do more than anything
else to restore spirit and economy to an
industry which had long become dejected, suspicious
and wasteful; and it will help to remove
jealousy and distrust between townsmen and countrymen.
The allotment holder, if encouraged and
given fixity of tenure, or at all events the power of
getting fresh ground if he must give up what he
has&mdash;a vital matter&mdash;will become the necessary
link between town and country, with mind open
to the influence of both. The more he is brought
into working contact with the small holder and
the large farmer the better he will appreciate his
own importance to the country and ensure theirs.
But this contact can only be established through
some central body, and by use of a wholesale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
society for trading and other purposes, such as
has just been set up for all classes of co-operated
agriculturalists.</p>

<p>Addressing a recent meeting of its members,
the Chairman of the Agricultural Organisation
Society, Mr. Leslie Scott, spoke thus:&mdash;"We have
to cover the country" (with co-operative societies),
"and we have got to get all the farmers in! If
we can carry out any such scheme as this, which
will rope in all the farmers of the country, what
a magnificent position we shall be in! You will
have your great trading organisation with its
central wholesale society! You will have your
organisation side with the Agricultural Organisation
Society at the centre.... You will be able
to use that side for all the ancillary purposes
connected with farming; and do a great deal in
the way of expert assistance. And through your
electing the Board of Governors of the Agricultural
Organisation Society, with the provincial
branch Committees, you will have what is in
effect a central Parliament in London.... You
will be able to put before the country, both locally
and here in London, the views of the farming
community, and, those views will get from Government
Departments an attention which the
farming industry in the past has failed to get.
You will command a power in the country."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
And in a letter to Mr. Scott, read at the same
meeting, the present Minister of Agriculture had
this to say about co-operation:</p>

<p>"Farming is a business in which as in every
other industry union is strength.... Every
farmer should belong to a co-operative society....
Small societies like small farmers, must"
(in their turn) "co-operate.... The word
'farmers' is intended to include all those who cultivate
the land. In this sense allotment holders
are farmers, and I trust that the union of all cultivators
of the land in this sense will help to
bridge the gap between town and country."</p>

<p>That townsman and countryman should feel
their interests to be at bottom the same goes to
the root of any land revival.</p>


<h3>
<br />
VII</h3>

<h3>VALEDICTORY</h3>

<p>"There are many who contend that the nation
will never again allow its rural industry to be
neglected and discouraged as it was in the past;
that the war has taught a lesson which will not
soon be forgotten. This view of the national
temperament is considered by others to be too
confident. It is the firm conviction of this school
that the consumer will speedily return to his old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
habit of indifference to national stability in the
matter of food, and that Parliament acting at his
bidding, will manifest equal apathy."</p>

<p>These words, taken from a leader in <i>The Times</i>
of February 11th, 1918, bring me back to the
starting point of these ragged reflections. There
will be no permanent stablishing of our agriculture,
no lasting advance towards safety and health,
if we have not vision and a fixed ideal. The ruts
of the past were deep, and our habit is to walk
along without looking to left or right. A Liberalism
worthy of the word should lift its head and
see new paths. The Liberalism of the past, bent
on the improvement of the people and the growth
of good-will between nations, forgot in that absorption
to take in the whole truth. Fixing its eyes
on measures which should redeem the evils of
the day, it did not see that those evils were growing
faster than all possible remedy, because we
had forgotten that a great community bountifully
blessed by Nature has no business to exist
parasitically on the earth produce of other communities;
and because our position under pure free trade,
and pure industrialism, was making
us a tempting bait for aggression, and retarding
the very good-will between nations which it desired
so earnestly.</p>

<p>The human animal perishes if not fed. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
have gone so far with our happy-go-lucky scheme
of existence that it has become necessary to remind
ourselves of that. So long as we had money
we thought we could continue to exist. Not so.
Henceforth till we feed ourselves again, we live
on sufferance, and dangle before all eyes the apple
of discord. A self-supporting Britain, free from
this carking fear, would become once more a
liberalising power. A Britain fed from overseas
can only be an Imperialistic Junker, armed to the
teeth, jealous and doubtful of each move by any
foreigner; prizing quantity not quality; indifferent
about the condition of his heart. Such a
Britain dare not be liberal if it will.</p>

<p>The greatest obstacle to a true League of
Nations, with the exception of the condition of
Russia, will be the condition of Britain, till she
can feed herself.</p>

<p>I believe in the principle of free trade, because
it forces man to put his best leg foremost. But
all is a question of degree in this world. It is no
use starting a donkey, in the Derby, and bawling
in its ear: "A fair field and no favour!" especially
if all your money is on the donkey. All our
money is henceforth on our agriculture till we
have brought it into its own. And that can only
be done at present with the help of bounty.</p>

<p>The other day a Canadian free trader said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
"It all depends on what sort of peace we secure;
if we have a crushing victory, I see no reason
why Britain should not go on importing her
food."</p>

<p>Fallacy&mdash;politically and biologically! The
worst thing that could happen to us after the
war would be a sense of perfect security, in which
to continue to neglect our agriculture and increase
our towns. Does any man think that a
momentary exhaustion of our enemy is going to
prevent that huge and vigorous nation from becoming
strong again? Does he believe that we
can trust a League of Nations&mdash;a noble project,
for which we must all work&mdash;to prevent war till
we have seen it successful for at least a generation?
Does he consider that our national physique
will stand another fifty years of rampant
industrialism without fresh country stocks to
breed from? Does he suppose that the use of
the air and the underparts of the sea is more
than just beginning?</p>

<p>Politically, our independence in the matter of
food is essential to good will between the nations.
Biologically, more country life is essential to
British health. The improvement of town and
factory conditions may do something to arrest
degeneration, but in my firm conviction it cannot
hope to do enough in a land where towns have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
been allowed to absorb seven-ninths of the population,
and&mdash;such crowded, grimy towns!</p>

<p>Even from the economic point of view it will
be far cheaper to restore the countryside and re-establish
agriculture on a paying basis than to
demolish and rebuild our towns till they become
health resorts. And behind it all there is this:
Are we satisfied with the trend of our modern
civilisation? Are we easy in our consciences?
Have not machines, and the demands of industry
run away with our sense of proportion? Grant
for a moment that this age marks the highest
water so far of British advance. Are we content
with that high-water mark? In health, happiness,
taste, beauty, we are surely far from the
ideal. I do not say that restoration of the land
will work a miracle; but I do say that nothing
we can do will benefit us so potently as the redress
of balance between town and country life.</p>

<p>We are at the parting of the ways. The war
has brought us realisation and opportunity. We
can close our eyes again and drift, or we can move
forward under the star of a new ideal. The principle
which alone preserves the sanity of nations
is the principle of balance. Not even the most
enraged defender of our present condition will
dare maintain that we have followed out that
principle. The scales are loaded in favour of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
towns, till they almost touch earth; unless our
eyes are cleared to see that, unless our will is
moved to set it right, we shall bump the ground
before another two decades have slipped away,
and in the mud shall stay, an invitation to any
trampling heel.</p>

<p>I have tried to indicate general measures and
considerations vital to the resettlement of the
land, conscious that some of my readers will have
forgotten more than I know, and that what could
be said would fill volumes. But the thought
which, of all others, I have wished to convey is
this: Without vision we perish. Without apprehension
of danger and ardour for salvation in the
great body of this people there is no hope of anything
save a momentary spurt, which will die
away, and leave us plodding down the hill. There
are two essentials. The farmer&mdash;and that means
every cultivator of the land&mdash;must have faith in
the vital importance of his work and in the
possibility of success; the townsman must see and
believe that the future of the country, and with
it his own prosperity, is involved in the revival
of our agriculture and bound up with our independence
of oversea supply. Without that vision
and belief in the townsman the farmer will never
regain faith, and without that faith of the farmer
agriculture will not revive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
Statesmen may contrive, reformers plan, farmers
struggle on, but if there be not conviction in
the body politic, it will be no use.</p>

<p>Resettlement of the land, and independence of
outside food supply, is the only hope of welfare
and safety for this country. Fervently believing
that, I have set down these poor words.</p>

<h3>I</h3>


<p>The Angel Æthereal, on his official visit to the
Earth in 1947, paused between the Bank and the
Stock Exchange to smoke a cigarette and scrutinise
the passers-by.</p>

<p>"How they swarm," he said, "and with what
seeming energy&mdash;in such an atmosphere! Of
what can they be made?"</p>

<p>"Of money, sir," replied his dragoman; "in the
past, the present, or the future. Stocks are booming.
The barometer of joy stands very high.
Nothing like it has been known for thirty years;
not, indeed, since the days of the Great Skirmish."</p>

<p>"There is, then, a connection between joy and
money?" remarked the Angel, letting smoke
dribble through his chiselled nostrils.</p>

<p>"Such is the common belief; though to prove it
might take time. I will, however, endeavour to
do this if you desire it, sir."</p>

<p>"I certainly do," said the Angel; "for a less
joyous-looking crowd I have seldom seen. Between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
every pair of brows there is a furrow, and
no one whistles."</p>

<p>"You do not understand," returned his dragoman;
"nor indeed is it surprising, for it is not so
much the money as the thought that some day
you need no longer make it which causes joy."</p>

<p>"If that day is coming to all," asked the Angel,
"why do they not look joyful?"</p>

<p>"It is not so simple as that, sir. To the majority
of these persons that day will never come,
and many of them know it&mdash;these are called
clerks; to some amongst the others, even, it will
not come&mdash;these will be called bankrupts; to the
rest it will come, and they will live at Wimblehurst
and other islands of the blessed, when they
have become so accustomed to making money
that to cease making it will be equivalent to boredom,
if not torture, or when they are so old that
they can but spend it in trying to modify the disabilities
of age."</p>

<p>"What price joy, then?" said the Angel, raising
his eyebrows. "For that, I fancy, is the expression
you use?"</p>

<p>"I perceive, sir," answered his dragoman,
"that you have not yet regained your understanding
of the human being, and especially of
the breed which inhabits this country. Illusion
is what we are after. Without our illusions we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
might just as well be angels or Frenchmen, who
pursue at all events to some extent the sordid
reality known as '<i>le plaisir</i>,' or enjoyment of life.
In pursuit of illusion we go on making money and
furrows in our brows, for the process is wearing.
I speak, of course, of the bourgeoisie or Patriotic
classes; for the practice of the Laborious is different,
though their illusions are the same."</p>

<p>"How?" asked the Angel briefly.</p>

<p>"Why, sir, both hold the illusion that they will
one day be joyful through the possession of money;
but whereas the Patriotic expect to make it
through the labour of the Laborious, the Laborious
expect to make it through the labour of the
Patriotic."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" said the Angel.</p>

<p>"Angels may laugh," replied his dragoman,
"but it is a matter to make men weep."</p>

<p>"You know your own business best," said the
Angel, "I suppose."</p>

<p>"Ah! sir, if we did, how pleasant it would be.
It is frequently my fate to study the countenances
and figures of the population, and I find the joy
which the pursuit of illusion brings them is insufficient
to counteract the confined, monotonous
and worried character of their lives."</p>

<p>"They are certainly very plain," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"They are," sighed his dragoman, "and getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
plainer every day. Take for instance that
one," and he pointed to a gentleman going up the
steps. "Mark how he is built. The top of his
grizzled head is narrow, the bottom of it broad.
His body is short and thick and square; his legs
even thicker, and his feet turn out too much; the
general effect is almost pyramidal. Again, take
this one," and he indicated a gentleman coming
down the steps, "you could thread his legs and
body through a needle's eye, but his head would
defy you. Mark his boiled eyes, his flashing
spectacles, and the absence of all hair. Disproportion,
sir, has become endemic."</p>

<p>"Can this not be corrected?" asked the Angel.</p>

<p>"To correct a thing," answered his dragoman,
"you must first be aware of it, and these are not;
no more than they are aware that it is disproportionate
to spend six days out of every seven in a
counting-house or factory. Man, sir, is the
creature of habit, and when his habits are bad,
man is worse."</p>

<p>"I have a headache," said the Angel; "the noise
is more deafening than it was when I was here
in 1910."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; since then we have had the Great
Skirmish, an event which furiously intensified
money-making. We, like every other people,
have ever since been obliged to cultivate the art<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
of getting five out of two-and-two. The progress
of civilisation has been considerably speeded up
thereby, and everything but man has benefited;
even horses, for they are no longer overloaded
and overdriven up Tower Hill or any other."</p>

<p>"How is that," asked the Angel, "if the pressure
of work is greater?"</p>

<p>"Because they are extinct," said his dragoman;
"entirely superseded by electric and air traction,
as you see."</p>

<p>"You appear to be inimical to money," the
Angel interjected, with a penetrating look. "Tell
me, would you really rather own one shilling than
five and sixpence?"</p>

<p>"Sir," replied his dragoman, "you are putting
the candidate before the caucus, as the saying is.
For money is nothing but the power to purchase
what one wants. You should rather be inquiring
what I want."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you?" said the Angel.</p>

<p>"To my thinking," answered his dragoman,
"instead of endeavouring to increase money when
we found ourselves so very bankrupt, we should
have endeavoured to decrease our wants. The
path of real progress, sir, is the simplification of
life and desire till we have dispensed even with
trousers and wear a single clean garment reaching
to the knees; till we are content with exercising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
our own limbs on the solid earth; the eating
of simple food we have grown ourselves; the hearing
of our own voices, and tunes on oaten straws;
the feel on our faces of the sun and rain and wind;
the scent of the fields and woods; the homely
roof, and the comely wife unspoiled by heels,
pearls, and powder; the domestic animals at
play, wild birds singing, and children brought up
to colder water than their fathers. It should have
been our business to pursue health till we no longer
needed the interior of the chemist's shop, the optician's
store, the hairdresser's, the corset-maker's,
the thousand and one emporiums which patch and
prink us, promoting our fancies and disguising
the ravages which modern life makes in our figures.
Our ambition should have been to need so
little that, with our present scientific knowledge,
we should have been able to produce it very easily
and quickly, and have had abundant leisure
and sound nerves and bodies wherewith to enjoy
nature, art, and the domestic affections. The
tragedy of man, sir, is his senseless and insatiate
curiosity and greed, together with his incurable
habit of neglecting the present for the sake of a
future which will never come."</p>

<p>"You speak like a book," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"I wish I did," retorted his dragoman, "for no
book I am able to procure enjoins us to stop this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
riot, and betake ourselves to the pleasurable
simplicity which alone can save us."</p>

<p>"You would be bored stiff in a week," said the
Angel.</p>

<p>"We should, sir," replied his dragoman, "because
from our schooldays we are brought up to
be acquisitive, competitive, and restless. Consider
the baby in the perambulator, absorbed in
contemplating the heavens and sucking its own
thumb. Existence, sir, should be like that."</p>

<p>"A beautiful metaphor," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"As it is, we do but skip upon the hearse of
life."</p>

<p>"You would appear to be of those whose motto
is: 'Try never to leave things as you find them,'"
observed the Angel.</p>

<p>"Ah, sir!" responded his dragoman, with a
sad smile, "the part of a dragoman is rather ever
to try and find things where he leaves them."</p>

<p>"Talking of that," said the Angel dreamily,
"when I was here in 1910, I bought some Marconi's
for the rise. What are they at now?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you," replied his dragoman in a
deprecating voice, "but this I will say: Inventors
are not only the benefactors but the curses of
mankind, and will be so long as we do not find
a way of adapting their discoveries to our very
limited digestive powers. The chronic dyspepsia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
of our civilisation, due to the attempt to swallow
every pabulum which ingenuity puts before it,
is so violent that I sometimes wonder whether
we shall survive until your visit in 1984."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Angel, pricking his ears; "you
really think there is a chance?"</p>

<p>"I do indeed," his dragoman answered gloomily.
"Life is now one long telephone call&mdash;and what's
it all about? A tour in darkness! A rattling of
wheels under a sky of smoke! A never-ending
game of poker!"</p>

<p>"Confess," said the Angel, "that you have
eaten something which has not agreed with you?"</p>

<p>"It is so," answered his dragoman; "I have
eaten of modernity, the damndest dish that was
ever set to lips. Look at those fellows," he went
on, "busy as ants from nine o'clock in the morning
to seven in the evening. And look at their
wives!"</p>

<p>"Ah! yes," said the Angel cheerily; "let us
look at their wives," and with three strokes of
his wings he passed to Oxford Street.</p>

<p>"Look at them!" repeated his dragoman,
"busy as ants from ten o'clock in the morning
to five in the evening."</p>

<p>"Plain is not the word for <i>them</i>," said the
Angel sadly. "What are they after, running in
and out of these shop-holes?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
"Illusion, sir. The romance of business there,
the romance of commerce here. They have got
into these habits and, as you know, it is so much
easier to get in than to get out. Would you like
to see one of their homes?"</p>

<p>"No, no," said the Angel, starting back and
coming into contact with a lady's hat. "Why do
they have them so large?" he asked, with a certain
irritation.</p>

<p>"In order that they may have them small next
season," replied his dragoman. "The future, sir;
the future! The cycle of beauty and eternal hope,
and, incidentally, <i>the good of trade</i>. Grasp that
phrase and you will have no need for further inquiry,
and probably no inclination."</p>

<p>"One could get American sweets in here, I
guess," said the Angel, entering.</p>


<h3>
<br />
II</h3>

<p>"And where would you wish to go to-day,
sir?" asked his dragoman of the Angel who was
moving his head from side to side like a dromedary
in the Haymarket.</p>

<p>"I should like," the Angel answered, "to go
into the country."</p>

<p>"The country!" returned his dragoman, doubtfully.
"You will find very little to see there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
"Natheless," said the Angel, spreading his
wings.</p>

<p>"These," gasped his dragoman, after a few
breathless minutes, "are the Chilterns&mdash;they will
serve; any part of the country is now the same.
Shall we descend?"</p>

<p>Alighting on what seemed to be a common, he
removed the cloud moisture from his brow, and
shading his eyes with his hand, stood peering into
the distance on every side. "As I thought," he
said; "there has been no movement since I
brought the Prime here in 1944; we shall have
some difficulty in getting lunch."</p>

<p>"A wonderfully peaceful spot," said the
Angel.</p>

<p>"True," said his dragoman. "We might fly
sixty miles in any direction and not see a house
in repair."</p>

<p>"Let us!" said the Angel. They flew a hundred,
and alighted again.</p>

<p>"Same here!" said his dragoman. "This is
Leicestershire. Note the rolling landscape of
wild pastures."</p>

<p>"I am getting hungry," said the Angel. "Let
us fly again."</p>

<p>"I have told you, sir," remarked his dragoman,
while they were flying, "that we shall have the
greatest difficulty in finding any inhabited dwelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
in the country. Had we not better alight
at Blackton or Bradleeds?"</p>

<p>"No," said the Angel. "I have come for a
day in the fresh air."</p>

<p>"Would bilberries serve?" asked his dragoman;
"for I see a man gathering them."</p>

<p>The Angel closed his wings, and they dropped
on to a moor close to an aged man.</p>

<p>"My worthy wight," said the Angel, "we are
hungry. Would you give us some of your bilberries?"</p>

<p>"Wot oh!" ejaculated the ancient party;
"never 'eard yer comin'. Been flyin' by wireless,
'ave yer? Got an observer, I see," he added,
jerking his grizzled chin at the dragoman. "Strike
me, it's the good old dyes o' the Gryte Skirmish
over agyne."</p>

<p>"Is this," asked the Angel, whose mouth was
already black with bilberries, "the dialect of rural
England?"</p>

<p>"I will interrogate him, sir," said his dragoman,
"for in truth I am at a loss to account for
the presence of a man in the country." He took
the old person by his last button and led him a
little apart. Returning to the Angel, who had
finished the bilberries, he whispered:</p>

<p>"It is as I thought. This is the sole survivor
of the soldiers settled on the land at the conclusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
of the Great Skirmish. He lives on berries
and birds who have died a natural death."</p>

<p>"I fail to understand," answered the Angel.
"Where is all the rural population, where the
mansions of the great, the thriving farmer, the
contented peasant, the labourer about to have his
minimum wage, the Old, the Merrie England of
1910?"</p>

<p>"That," responded his dragoman somewhat
dramatically, extending his hand towards the old
man, "<i>that</i> is the rural population, and he a cockney
hardened in the Great Skirmish, or he could
never have stayed the course."</p>

<p>"What!" said the Angel; "is no food grown in
all this land!"</p>

<p>"Not a cabbage," replied his dragoman; "not
a mustard and cress&mdash;outside the towns, that is."</p>

<p>"I perceive," said the Angel, "that I have lost
touch with much that is of interest. Give me, I
pray, a brief sketch of the agricultural movement."</p>

<p>"Why, sir," replied his dragoman, "the agricultural
movement in this country since the days
of the Great Skirmish, when all were talking of
resettling the land, may be summed up in two
words: 'Town Expansion.' In order to make this
clear to you, however, I must remind you of the
political currents of the past thirty years. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
will not recollect that during the Great Skirmish,
beneath the seeming absence of politics, there
were germinating the Parties of the future. A
secret but resolute intention was forming in all
minds to immolate those who had played any part
in politics before and during the important world-tragedy
which was then being enacted, especially
such as continued to hold portfolios, or persisted
in asking questions in the House of Commons, as
it was then called. It was not that people held
them to be responsible, but nerves required soothing,
and there is no anodyne, as you know, sir,
equal to human sacrifice. The politician was, as
one may say&mdash;'off.' No sooner, of course, was
peace declared than the first real General Election
was held, and it was with a certain chagrin that
the old Parties found themselves in the soup.
The Parties which had been forming beneath the
surface swept the country; one called itself the
Patriotic, and was called by its opponents the
Prussian Party; the other called itself the Laborious,
and was called by its opponents the
Loafing Party. Their representatives were nearly
all new men. In the first flush of peace, with
which the human mind ever associates plenty,
they came out on such an even keel that no Government
could pass anything at all. Since, however,
it was imperative to find the interest on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
National Debt of £8,000,000,000, a further election
was needed. This time, though the word
Peace remained, the word Plenty had already
vanished; and the Laborious Party, which, having
much less to tax, felt that it could tax more
freely, found itself in an overwhelming majority.
You will be curious to hear, sir, of what elements
this Party was composed. Its solid bulk were
the returned soldiers, and the other manual
workers of the country; but to this main body
there was added a rump, of pundits, men of excellent
intentions, brains, and principles, such as
in old days had been known as Radicals and
advanced Liberals. These had joined out of
despair, feeling that otherwise their very existence
was jeopardised. To this collocation&mdash;and to one
or two other circumstances, as you will presently
see, sir&mdash;the doom of the land must be traced.
Now, the Laborious Party, apart from its rump,
on which it would or could not sit&mdash;we shall never
know now&mdash;had views about the resettlement
of the land not far divergent from those held by
the Patriotic Party, and they proceeded to put
a scheme into operation, which, for perhaps a
year, seemed to have a prospect of success.
Many returned soldiers were established in favourable
localities, and there was even a disposition
to place the country on a self-sufficing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
basis in regard to food. But they had not been
in power eighteen months when their rump&mdash;which,
as I have told you, contained nearly all
their principles&mdash;had a severe attack of these.
'Free Trade,'&mdash;which, say what you will, follows
the line of least resistance and is based on the
'good of trade'&mdash;was, they perceived, endangered,
and they began to agitate against bonuses on corn
and preferential treatment of a pampered industry.
The bonus on corn was in consequence rescinded
in 1924, and in lieu thereof the system
of small holdings was extended&mdash;on paper. At
the same time the somewhat stunning taxation
which had been placed upon the wealthy began
to cause the break-up of landed estates. As the
general bankruptcy and exhaustion of Europe became
more and more apparent the notion of
danger from future war began to seem increasingly
remote, and the 'good of trade' became
again the one object before every British eye.
Food from overseas was cheapening once more.
The inevitable occurred. Country mansions became
a drug in the market, farmers farmed at a
loss; small holders went bust daily, and emigrated;
agricultural labourers sought the towns. In 1926
the Laborious Party, who had carried the taxation
of their opponents to a pitch beyond the
power of human endurance, got what the racy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
call 'the knock,' and the four years which followed
witnessed the bitterest internecine struggle
within the memory of every journalist. In the
course of this strife emigration increased and the
land emptied rapidly. The final victory of the
Laborious Party, in 1930, saw them, still propelled
by their rump, committed, among other
things, to a pure town policy. They have never
been out of power since; the result you see.
Food is now entirely brought from overseas,
largely by submarine and air service, in tabloid
form, and expanded to its original proportions on
arrival by an ingenious process discovered by a
German. The country is now used only as a
subject for sentimental poets, and to fly over, or
by lovers on bicycles at week-ends."</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" said the Angel thoughtfully.
"To me, indeed, it seems that this must have
been a case of: 'Oh! What a surprise!'"</p>

<p>"You are not mistaken, sir," replied his dragoman;
"people still open their mouths over this
consummation. It is pre-eminently an instance
of what will happen sometimes when you are not
looking, even to the English, who have been most
fortunate in this respect. For you must remember
that all Parties, even the Pundits, have always
declared that rural life and all that, don't
you know, is most necessary, and have ever asserted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
that they were fostering it to the utmost.
But they forgot to remember that our circumstances,
traditions, education, and vested interests
so favoured town life and the 'good of trade'
that it required a real and unparliamentary effort
not to take that line of least resistance. In fact,
we have here a very good example of what I told
you the other day was our most striking characteristic&mdash;never
knowing where we are till after
the event. But what with fog and principles,
how can you expect we should? Better be a
little town blighter with no constitution and high
political principles, than your mere healthy country
product of a pampered industry. But you
have not yet seen the other side of the moon."</p>

<p>"To what do you refer?" asked the Angel.</p>

<p>"Why, sir, to the glorious expansion of the
towns. To this I shall introduce you to-morrow,
if such is your pleasure."</p>

<p>"Is London, then, not a town?" asked the Angel
playfully.</p>

<p>"London?" cried his dragoman; "a mere pleasure
village. To which real town shall I take
you? Liverchester?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere," said the Angel, "where I can get
a good dinner." So-saying, he paid the rural
population with a smile and spread his wings.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>
<h3>
<br />
III</h3>

<p>"The night is yet young," said the Angel
Æthereal on leaving the White Heart Hostel at
Liverchester, "and I have had perhaps too much
to eat. Let us walk and see the town."</p>

<p>"As you will, sir," replied his dragoman;
"there is no difference between night and day,
now that they are using the tides for the provision
of electric power."</p>

<p>The Angel took a note of the fact. "What do
they manufacture here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The entire town," returned his dragoman,
"which now extends from the old Liverpool to
the old Manchester (as indeed its name implies),
is occupied with expanding the tabloids of food
which are landed in its port from the new worlds.
This and the town of Brister, reaching from the
old Bristol to the old Gloucester, have had the
monopoly of food expansion for the United Kingdom
since 1940."</p>

<p>"By what means precisely?" asked the Angel.</p>

<p>"Congenial environment and bacteriology," responded
his dragoman. They walked for some
time in silence, flying a little now and then in the
dirtier streets, before the Angel spoke again:</p>

<p>"It is curious," he said, "but I perceive no
difference between this town and those I remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
on my visit in 1910, save that the streets
are better lighted, which is not an unmixed joy,
for they are dirty and full of people whose faces
do not please me."</p>

<p>"Ah! sir," replied his dragoman, "it is too
much to expect that the wonderful darkness which
prevailed at the time of the Great Skirmish could
endure; then, indeed, one could indulge the hope
that the houses were all built by Wren, and the
people all clean and beautiful. There is no
poetry now."</p>

<p>"No!" said the Angel, sniffing, "but there is
atmosphere, and it is not agreeable."</p>

<p>"Mankind, when herded together, <i>will</i> smell,"
answered his dragoman. "You cannot avoid it.
What with old clothes, patchouli, petrol, fried
fish and the fag, those five essentials of human
life, the atmosphere of Turner and Corot are as
nothing."</p>

<p>"But do you not run your towns to please
yourselves?" said the Angel.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir! The resistance would be dreadful.
They run us. You see, they are so very
big, and have such prestige. Besides," he added,
"even if we dared, we should not know how.
For, though some great and good man once
brought us plane-trees, we English are above getting
the best out of life and its conditions, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
despise light Frenchified taste. Notice the principle
which governs this twenty-mile residential
stretch. It was intended to be light, but how
earnest it has all turned out! You can tell at a
glance that these dwellings belong to the species
'house' and yet are individual houses, just as a
man belongs to the species 'man,' and yet, as
they say, has a soul of his own. This principle
was introduced off the Avenue Road a few years
before the Great Skirmish, and is now universal.
Any person who lives in a house identical with
another house is not known. Has anything
heavier and more conscientious ever been
seen?"</p>

<p>"Does this principle also apply to the houses
of the working-man?" inquired the Angel.</p>

<p>"Hush, sir!" returned his dragoman, looking
round him nervously; "a dangerous word. The
<span class="smcap">Laborious</span> dwell in palaces built after the design
of an architect called Jerry, with communal
kitchens and baths."</p>

<p>"Do they use them?" asked the Angel with
some interest.</p>

<p>"Not as yet, indeed," replied his dragoman;
"but I believe they are thinking of it. As you
know, sir, it takes time to introduce a custom.
Thirty years is but as yesterday."</p>

<p>"The Japanese wash daily," mused the Angel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
"Not a Christian nation," replied his dragoman;
"nor have they the dirt to contend with
which is conspicuous here. Let us do justice to
the discouragement which dogs the ablutions of
such as know they will soon be dirty again. It
was confidently supposed, at the time of the Great
Skirmish, which introduced military discipline
and so entirely abolished caste, that the habit of
washing would at last become endemic throughout
the whole population. Judge how surprised
were we of that day when the facts turned out
otherwise. Instead of the Laborious washing
more, the Patriotic washed less. It may have
been the higher price of soap, or merely that
human life was not very highly regarded at the
time. We cannot tell. But not until military
discipline disappeared, and caste was restored,
which happened the moment peace returned, did
the survivors of the Patriotic begin to wash immoderately
again, leaving the Laborious to preserve
a level more suited to democracy."</p>

<p>"Talking of levels," said the Angel; "is the
populace increasing in stature?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, indeed!" responded his dragoman;
"the latest statistics give a diminution of one
inch and a half during the past generation."</p>

<p>"And in longevity?" asked the Angel.</p>

<p>"As to that, babies and old people are now communally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
treated, and all those diseases which are
curable by lymph are well in hand."</p>

<p>"Do people, then, not die?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir! About as often as before.
There are new complaints which redress the
balance."</p>

<p>"And what are those?"</p>

<p>"A group of diseases called for convenience
Scienticitis. Some think they come from the
present food system; others from the accumulation
of lymphs in the body; others, again, regard
them as the result of dwelling on the subject&mdash;a
kind of hypnotisation by death; a fourth school
hold them traceable to town air; while a fifth
consider them a mere manifestation of jealousy
on the part of Nature. They date, one may say,
with confidence, from the time of the Great Skirmish,
when men's minds were turned with some
anxiety to the question of statistics, and babies
were at a premium."</p>

<p>"Is the population, then, much larger?"</p>

<p>"You mean smaller, sir, do you not? Not perhaps
so much smaller as you might expect; but
it is still nicely down. You see, the Patriotic
Party, including even those Pontificals whose private
practice most discouraged all that sort of
thing, began at once to urge propagation. But
their propaganda was, as one may say, brain-spun;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
and at once bumped up&mdash;pardon the colloquialism&mdash;against
the economic situation. The
existing babies, it is true, were saved; the trouble
was rather that the babies began not to exist.
The same, of course, obtained in every European
country, with the exception of what was still,
in a manner of speaking, Russia; and if that
country had but retained its homogeneity, it
would soon by sheer numbers have swamped the
rest of Europe. Fortunately, perhaps, it did not
remain homogeneous. An incurable reluctance
to make food for cannon and impose further burdens
on selves already weighted to the ground by
taxes, developed in the peoples of each Central
and Western land; and in the years from 1920 to
1930 the downward curve was so alarming in
Great Britain that if the Patriotic Party could
only have kept office long enough at a time they
would, no doubt, have enforced conception at
the point of the bayonet. Luckily or unluckily,
according to taste, they did not; and it was left
for more natural causes to produce the inevitable
reaction which began to set in after 1930, when
the population of the United Kingdom had been
reduced to some twenty-five millions. About
that time commerce revived. The question of
the land had been settled by its unconscious
abandonment, and people began to see before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
them again the possibility of supporting families.
The ingrained disposition of men and women to
own pets, together with 'the good of trade,' began
once more to have its way; and the population
rose rapidly. A renewed joy in life, and the
assurance of not having to pay the piper, caused
the slums, as they used to be called, to swarm
once more, and filled the communal crèches.
And had it not been for the fact that any one
with physical strength, or love of fresh air,
promptly emigrated to the Sister Nations on
attaining the age of eighteen we might now, sir,
be witnessing an overcrowding equal to that of
the times before the Great Skirmish. The movement
is receiving an added impetus with the approach
of the Greater Skirmish between the Teutons
and Mongolians, for it is expected that trade
will boom and much wealth accrue to those countries
which are privileged to look on with equanimity
at this great new drama, as the editors
are already calling it."</p>

<p>"In all this," said the Angel Æthereal, "I perceive
something rather sordid."</p>

<p>"Sir," replied his dragoman earnestly, "your
remark is characteristic of the sky, where people
are not made of flesh and blood; pay, I believe,
no taxes; and have no experience of the devastating
consequences of war. I recollect so well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
when I was a young man, before the Great Skirmish
began, and even when it had been going on
several years, how glibly the leaders of opinion
talked of human progress, and how blind they
were to the fact that it has a certain connection
with environment. You must remember that
ever since that large and, as some still think,
rather tragic occurrence environment has been
very dicky and Utopia not unrelated to thin air.
It has been perceived time and again that the
leaders of public opinion are not always confirmed
by events. The new world, which was so
sapiently prophesied by rhetoricians, is now nigh
thirty years old, and, for my part, I confess to
surprise that it is not worse than it actually is.
I am moralising, I fear, however, for these suburban
buildings grievously encourage the philosophic
habit. Rather let us barge along and
see the Laborious at their labours, which are
never interrupted now by the mere accident of
night."</p>

<p>The Angel increased his speed till they alighted
amid a forest of tall chimneys, whose sirens were
singing like a watch of nightingales.</p>

<p>"There is a shift on," said the dragoman.
"Stand here, sir; we shall see them passing in
and out."</p>

<p>The Laborious were not hurrying, and went by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
uttering the words: "Cheer oh!" "So long!"
and "Wot abaht it!"</p>

<p>The Angel contemplated them for a time before
he said: "It comes back to me now how they
used to talk when they were doing up my flat
on my visit in 1910."</p>

<p>"Give me, I pray, an imitation," said his dragoman.</p>

<p>The Angel struck the attitude of one painting
a door. "William," he said, rendering those
voices of the past, "what money are you obtaining?"</p>

<p>"Not half, Alfred."</p>

<p>"If that is so, indeed, William, should you not
rather leave your tools and obtain better money?
I myself am doing this."</p>

<p>"Not half, Alfred."</p>

<p>"Round the corner I can obtain more money by
working for fewer hours. In my opinion there is
no use in working for less money when you can
obtain more. How much does Henry obtain?"</p>

<p>"Not half, Alfred."</p>

<p>"What I am now obtaining is, in my opinion,
no use at all."</p>

<p>"Not half, Alfred."</p>

<p>Here the Angel paused, and let his hand move
for one second in a masterly exhibition of activity.</p>

<p>"It is doubtful, sir," said his dragoman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
"whether you would be permitted to dilute your
conversation with so much labour in these days;
the rules are very strict."</p>

<p>"Are there, then, still Trades Unions?" asked
the Angel.</p>

<p>"No, indeed," replied his dragoman; "but there
are Committees. That habit which grew up at
the time of the Great Skirmish has flourished ever
since. Statistics reveal the fact that there are
practically no adults in the country between the
ages of nineteen and fifty who are not sitting on
Committees. At the time of the Great Skirmish
all Committees were nominally active; they are
now both active and passive. In every industry,
enterprise, or walk of life a small active Committee
directs; and a large passive Committee,
formed of everybody else, resists that direction.
And it is safe to say that the Passive Committees
are active and the Active Committees passive;
in this way no inordinate amount of work is
done. Indeed, if the tongue and the electric
button had not usurped practically all the functions
of the human hand, the State would have
some difficulty in getting its boots blacked. But
a ha'poth of visualisation is worth three lectures
at ten shillings the stall, so enter, sir, and see for
yourself."</p>

<p>Saying this, he pushed open the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
In a shed, which extended beyond the illimitable
range of the Angel's eye, machinery and
tongues were engaged in a contest which filled
the ozone with an incomparable hum. Men and
women in profusion were leaning against walls or
the pillars on which the great roof was supported,
assiduously pressing buttons. The scent of expanding
food revived the Angel's appetite.</p>

<p>"I shall require supper," he said dreamily.</p>

<p>"By all means, sir," replied his dragoman;
"after work&mdash;play. It will afford you an opportunity
to witness modern pleasures in our great
industrial centres. But what a blessing is electric
power!" he added. "Consider these lilies of
the town, they toil not, neither do they spin&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yet Solomon in all his glory," chipped in the
Angel eagerly, "had not their appearance, you
bet."</p>

<p>"Indeed they are an insouciant crowd," mused
his dragoman. "How tinkling is their laughter!
The habit dates from the days of the Great Skirmish,
when nothing but laughter would meet the case."</p>

<p>"Tell me," said the Angel, "are the English
satisfied at last with their industrial conditions,
and generally with their mode of life in these expanded
towns?"</p>

<p>"Satisfied? Oh dear, no, sir! But you know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
what it is: They are obliged to wait for each
fresh development before they can see what they
have to counteract; and, since that great creative
force, 'the good of trade,' is always a little stronger
than the forces of criticism and reform, each development
carries them a little further on the
road to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hell! How hungry I am again!" exclaimed
the Angel. "Let us sup!"</p>


<h3>
<br />
IV</h3>

<p>"Laughter," said the Angel Æthereal, applying
his wineglass to his nose, "has ever distinguished
mankind from all other animals with the exception
of the dog. And the power of laughing at nothing
distinguishes man even from that quadruped."</p>

<p>"I would go further, sir," returned his dragoman,
"and say that the power of laughing at that
which should make him sick distinguishes the
Englishman from all other varieties of man except
the negro. Kindly observe!" He rose, and
taking the Angel by the waist, fox-trotted him
among the little tables.</p>

<p>"See!" he said, indicating the other supper-takers
with a circular movement of his beard,
"they are consumed with laughter. The habit of
fox-trotting in the intervals of eating has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
known ever since it was introduced by Americans
a generation ago, at the beginning of the
Great Skirmish, when that important people had
as yet nothing else to do; but it still causes laughter
in this country. A distressing custom," he
wheezed, as they resumed their seats, "for not
only does it disturb the oyster, but it compels one
to think lightly of the human species. Not that
one requires much compulsion," he added, "now
that music-hall, cinema, and restaurant are conjoined.
What a happy idea that was of Berlin's,
and how excellent for business! Kindly glance
for a moment&mdash;but not more&mdash;at the left-hand
stage."</p>

<p>The Angel turned his eyes towards a cinematograph
film which was being displayed. He contemplated
it for the moment without speaking.</p>

<p>"I do not comprehend," he said at last, "why
the person with the arrested moustaches is hitting
so many people with that sack of flour."</p>

<p>"To cause amusement, sir," replied his dragoman.
"Look at the laughing faces around you."</p>

<p>"But it is not funny," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"No, indeed," returned his dragoman. "Be so
good as to carry your eyes now to the stage on the
right, but not for long. What do you see?"</p>

<p>"I see a very red-nosed man beating a very
white-nosed man about the body."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
"It is a real scream, is it not?"</p>

<p>"No," said the Angel drily. "Does nothing
else ever happen on these stages?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. Stay! <i>Revues</i> happen!"</p>

<p>"What are <i>revues</i>?" asked the Angel.</p>

<p>"Criticisms of life, sir, as it would be seen by
persons inebriated on various intoxicants."</p>

<p>"They should be joyous."</p>

<p>"They are accounted so," his dragoman replied;
"but for my part, I prefer to criticise life
for myself, especially when I am drunk."</p>

<p>"Are there no plays, no operas?" asked the
Angel from behind his glass.</p>

<p>"Not in the old and proper sense of these words.
They disappeared towards the end of the Great
Skirmish."</p>

<p>"What food for the mind is there, then?"
asked the Angel, adding an oyster to his collection.</p>

<p>"None in public, sir, for it is well recognised,
and has been ever since those days, that laughter
alone promotes business and removes the thought
of death. You cannot recall, as I can, sir, the
continual stream which used to issue from theatres,
music-halls, and picture-palaces in the days
of the Great Skirmish, nor the joviality of the
Strand and the more expensive restaurants. I
have often thought," he added with a touch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
philosophy, "what a height of civilisation we
must have reached to go jesting, as we did, to the
Great Unknown."</p>

<p>"Is that really what the English did at the
time of the Great Skirmish?" asked the Angel.</p>

<p>"It is," replied his dragoman solemnly.</p>

<p>"Then they are a very fine people, and I can
put up with much about them which seems to
me distressing."</p>

<p>"Ah! sir, though, being an Englishman, I am
sometimes inclined to disparage the English, I am
yet convinced that you could not fly a week's
journey and come across another race with such
a peculiar nobility, or such an unconquerable
soul, if you will forgive my using a word whose
meaning is much disputed. May I tempt you
with a clam?" he added, more lightly. "We now
have them from America&mdash;in fair preservation,
and very nasty they are, in my opinion."</p>

<p>The Angel took a clam.</p>

<p>"My Lord!" he said, after a moment of deglutition.</p>

<p>"Quite so!" replied his dragoman. "But
kindly glance at the right-hand stage again.
There is a <i>revue</i> on now. What do you see?"</p>

<p>The Angel made two holes with his forefingers
and thumbs and, putting them to his eyes, bent
a little forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
"Tut, tut!" he said; "I see some attractive
young females with very few clothes on, walking
up and down in front of what seem to me, indeed,
to be two grown-up men in collars and jackets
as of little boys. What precise criticism of life
is this conveying?"</p>

<p>His dragoman answered in reproachful accents:</p>

<p>"Do you not feel, sir, from your own sensations,
how marvellously this informs one of the
secret passions of mankind? Is there not in it
a striking revelation of the natural tendencies of
the male population? Remark how the whole
audience, including your august self, is leaning
forward and looking through their thumb-holes?"</p>

<p>The Angel sat back hurriedly.</p>

<p>"True," he said, "I was carried away. But
that is not the criticism of life which art demands.
If it had been, the audience, myself
included, would have been sitting back with their
lips curled dry, instead of watering."</p>

<p>"For all that," replied his dragoman, "it is
the best we can give you; anything which induces
the detached mood of which you spoke, has been
banned from the stage since the days of the
Great Skirmish; it is so very bad for business."</p>

<p>"Pity!" said the Angel, imperceptibly edging
forward; "the mission of art is to elevate."</p>

<p>"It is plain, sir," said his dragoman, "that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
have lost touch with the world as it is. The mission
of art&mdash;now truly democratic&mdash;is to level&mdash;in
principle up, in practice down. Do not forget,
sir, that the English have ever regarded æstheticism
as unmanly, and grace as immoral; when to
that basic principle you add the principle of serving
the taste of the majority, you have perfect
conditions for a sure and gradual decrescendo."</p>

<p>"Does taste, then, no longer exist?" asked the
Angel.</p>

<p>"It is not wholly, as yet, extinct, but lingers in
the communal kitchens and canteens, as introduced
by the Young Men's Christian Association
in the days of the Great Skirmish. While there is
appetite there is hope, nor is it wholly discouraging
that taste should now centre in the stomach;
for is not that the real centre of man's activity?
Who dare affirm that from so universal a foundation
the fair structure of æstheticism shall not
be rebuilt? The eye, accustomed to the look of
dainty dishes and pleasant cookery, may once
more demand the architecture of Wren, the sculpture
of Rodin, the paintings of&mdash;dear me&mdash;whom?
Why, sir, even before the days of the Great
Skirmish, when you were last on earth, we had
already begun to put the future of æstheticism on
a more real basis, and were converting the concert-halls
of London into hotels. Few at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
time saw the far-reaching significance of that
movement, or realised that æstheticism was to be
levelled down to the stomach, in order that it
might be levelled up again to the head, on true
democratic principles."</p>

<p>"But what," said the Angel, with one of his
preternatural flashes of acumen, "what if, on the
other hand, taste should continue to sink and
lose even its present hold on the stomach? If
all else has gone, why should not the beauty of
the kitchen go?"</p>

<p>"That indeed," sighed his dragoman, placing
his hand on his heart, "is a thought which often
gives me a sinking sensation. Two liqueur
brandies," he murmured to the waiter. "But
the stout heart refuses to despair. Besides, advertisements
show decided traces of æsthetic
advance. All the great painters, poets, and fiction
writers are working on them; the movement
had its origin in the propaganda demanded by the
Great Skirmish. You will not recollect the war
poetry of that period, the patriotic films, the death
cartoons, and other remarkable achievements.
We have just as great talents now, though their
object has not perhaps the religious singleness of
those stirring times. Not a food, corset, or collar
which has not its artist working for it! Toothbrushes,
nutcrackers, babies' baths&mdash;the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
caboodle of manufacture&mdash;are now set to music.
Such themes are considered subliminal if not sublime.
No, sir, I will not despair; it is only at
moments when I have dined poorly that the
horizon seems dark. Listen&mdash;they have turned
on the 'Kalophone,' for you must know that all
music now is beautifully made by machine&mdash;so
much easier for every one."</p>

<p>The Angel raised his head, and into his eyes
came the glow associated with celestial strains.</p>

<p>"The tune," he said, "is familiar to me."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered his dragoman, "for it is
'The Messiah' in ragtime. No time is wasted,
you notice; all, even pleasure, is intensively cultivated,
on the lines of least resistance, thanks to
the feverishness engendered in us by the Great
Skirmish, when no one knew if he would have
another chance, and to the subsequent need for
fostering industry. But whether we really enjoy
ourselves is perhaps a question to answer
which you must examine the English character."</p>

<p>"That I refuse to do," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"And you are wise, sir, for it is a puzzler, and
many have cracked their heads over it. But have
we not been here long enough? We can pursue
our researches into the higher realms of art to-morrow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
A beam from the Angel's lustrous eyes fell on a
lady at the next table. "Yes, perhaps we had
better go," he sighed.</p>


<h3>
<br />
V</h3>

<p>"And so it is through the fields of true art that
we shall walk this morning?" said the Angel
Æthereal.</p>

<p>"Such as they are in this year of Peace 1947,"
responded his dragoman, arresting him before a
statue; "for the development of this hobby has
been peculiar since you were here in 1910, when
the childlike and contortionist movement was
just beginning to take hold of the British."</p>

<p>"Whom does this represent?" asked the Angel.</p>

<p>"A celebrated publicist, recently deceased at a
great age. You see him unfolded by this work of
multiform genius, in every aspect known to art,
religion, nature, and the population. From his
knees downwards he is clearly devoted to nature,
and is portrayed as about to enter his bath. From
his waist to his knees he is devoted to religion&mdash;mark
the complete disappearance of the human
aspect. From his neck to his waist he is devoted
to public affairs; observe the tweed coat, the
watch chain, and other signs of practical sobriety.
But the head is, after all, the crown of the human
being, and is devoted to art. This is why you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
cannot make out that it is a head. Note its
pyramidal severity, its cunning little ears, its box-built,
water-tightal structure. The hair you note
to be in flames. Here we have the touch of
beauty&mdash;the burning shrub. In the whole you will
observe that aversion from natural form and the
single point of view, characteristic of all twentieth-century
æsthetics. The whole thing is a very
great masterpiece of childlike contortionism.
To do things as irresponsibly as children and
contortionists&mdash;what a happy discovery of the
line of least resistance in art that was! Mark,
by the way, this exquisite touch about the left
hand."</p>

<p>"It appears to be deformed," said the Angel,
going a step nearer.</p>

<p>"Look closer still," returned his dragoman,
"and you will see that it is holding a novel of the
great Russian, upside down. Ever since that
simple master who so happily blended the childlike
with the contortionist became known in this
country they have been trying to go him one
better, in letters, in painting, in sculpture, and
in music, refusing to admit that he was the last
cry; and until they have beaten him this movement
simply cannot cease; it may therefore go on
for ever, for he was the limit. That hand symbolises
the whole movement."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
"How?" said the Angel.</p>

<p>"Why, sir, somersault is its mainspring. Did
you never observe the great Russian's method?
Prepare your characters to do one thing, and
make them very swiftly do the opposite. Thus
did that terrific novelist demonstrate his overmastering
range of vision and knowledge of the
depths of human nature. Since his characters
never varied this routine in the course of some
eight thousand pages, people have lightly said
that he repeated himself. But what of that?
Consider what perfect dissociation he thereby attained
between character and action; what nebulosity
of fact; what a truly childlike and mystic
mix-up of all human values hitherto known!
And here, sir, at the risk of tickling you, I must
whisper." The dragoman made a trumpet of his
hand: "Fiction can only be written by those who
have exceptionally little knowledge of ordinary
human nature, and great fiction only by such as
have none at all."</p>

<p>"How is that?" said the Angel, somewhat disconcerted.</p>

<p>"Surprise, sir, is the very kernel of all effects
in art, and in real life people <i>will</i> act as their characters
and temperaments determine that they
shall. This dreadful and unmalleable trait would
have upset all the great mystic masters from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
generation to generation if they had only noticed
it. But did they? Fortunately not. These
greater men naturally put into their books the
greater confusion and flux in which their extraordinary
selves exist! The nature they portray is
not human, but super- or subter-human, which
you will. Who would have it otherwise?"</p>

<p>"Not I," said the Angel. "For I confess to a
liking for what is called the 'tuppence coloured.'
But Russians are not as other men, are they?"</p>

<p>"They are not," said his dragoman, "but the
trouble is, sir, that since the British discovered
him, every character in our greater fiction has a
Russian soul, though living in Cornwall or the
Midlands, in a British body under a Scottish or
English name."</p>

<p>"Very piquant," said the Angel, turning from
the masterpiece before him. "Are there no undraped
statues to be seen?"</p>

<p>"In no recognisable form. For, not being educated
to the detached contemplation which still
prevailed to a limited extent even as late as the
days of the Great Skirmish, the populace can no
longer be trusted with such works of art; they are
liable to rush at them, for embrace, or demolition,
as their temperaments may dictate."</p>

<p>"The Greeks are dead, then," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"As door-nails, sir. They regarded life as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
thing to be enjoyed&mdash;a vice you will not have
noticed in the British. The Greeks were an outdoor
people, who lived in the sun and the fresh
air, and had none of the niceness bred by the life
of our towns. We have long been renowned for
our delicacy about the body; nor has the tendency
been decreased by constituting Watch Committees
of young persons in every borough. These
are now the arbiters of art, and nothing unsuitable
to the child of seven passes their censorship."</p>

<p>"How careful!" said the Angel.</p>

<p>"The result has been wonderful," remarked his
dragoman. "Wonderful!" he repeated, dreamily.
"I suppose there is more smouldering sexual desire
and disease in this country than in any
other."</p>

<p>"Was that the intention?" asked the Angel.</p>

<p>"Oh! no, sir! That is but the natural effect of
so remarkably pure a surface. All is within instead
of without. Nature has now wholly disappeared.
The process was sped up by the Great
Skirmish. For, since then, we have had little
leisure and income to spare on the gratification of
anything but laughter; this and the 'unco-guid'
have made our art-surface glare in the eyes of the
nations, thin and spotless as if made of tin."</p>

<p>The Angel raised his eyebrows. "I had hoped
for better things," he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
"You must not suppose, sir," pursued his
dragoman, "that there is not plenty of the undraped,
so long as it is vulgar, as you saw just
now upon the stage, for that is good business;
the line is only drawn at the danger-point of art,
which is always very bad business in this country.
Yet even in real life the undraped has to be
grotesque to be admitted; the one fatal quality
is natural beauty. The laugh, sir, the laugh&mdash;even
the most hideous and vulgar laugh&mdash;is such
a disinfectant. I should, however, say in justice
to our literary men, that they have not altogether
succumbed to the demand for cachinnations. A
school, which first drew breath before the Great
Skirmish began, has perfected itself, till now we
have whole tomes where hardly a sentence would
be intelligible to any save the initiate; this enables
them to defy the Watch Committees, with
other Philistines. We have writers who mysteriously
preach the realisation of self by never
considering anybody else; of purity through experience
of exotic vice; of courage through habitual
cowardice; and of kindness through Prussian
behaviour. They are generally young. We have
others whose fiction consists of autobiography interspersed
with philosophic and political fluencies.
These may be of any age from eighty odd to the
bitter thirties. We have also the copious and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
chatty novelist; and transcribers of the life of the
Laborious, whom the Laborious never read.
Above all, we have the great Patriotic school,
who put the national motto first, and write purely
what is good for trade. In fact, we have every
sort, as in the old days."</p>

<p>"It would appear," said the Angel, "that the
arts have stood somewhat still."</p>

<p>"Except for a more external purity, and a
higher internal corruption," replied his dragoman.</p>

<p>"Are artists still noted for their jealousies?"
asked the Angel.</p>

<p>"They are, sir; for that is inherent in the artistic
temperament, which is extremely touchy about
fame."</p>

<p>"And do they still get angry when those gentlemen&mdash;the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Critics," his dragoman suggested. "They
get angry, sir; but critics are usually anonymous,
and from excellent reasons; for not only are the
passions of an angry artist very high, but the
knowledge of an angry critic is not infrequently
very low, especially of art. It is kinder to save
life, where possible."</p>

<p>"For my part," said the Angel, "I have little
regard for human life, and consider that many
persons would be better buried."</p>

<p>"That may be," his dragoman retorted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
some irritation; "'<i>errare est humanum</i>.' But I,
for one, would rather be a dead human being any
day than a live angel, for I think they are more
charitable."</p>

<p>"Well," said the Angel genially, "you have the
prejudice of your kind. Have you an artist about
the place, to show me? I do not recollect any
at Madame Tussaud's."</p>

<p>"They have taken to declining that honour.
We could see one in real life if we went to Cornwall."</p>

<p>"Why Cornwall?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you, sir. There is something in
the air which affects their passions."</p>

<p>"I am hungry, and would rather go to the
Savoy," said the Angel, walking on.</p>

<p>"You are in luck," whispered his dragoman,
when they had seated themselves at a table covered
with prawns; "for at the next on your left
is our most famous exponent of the mosaic school
of novelism."</p>

<p>"Then here goes!" replied the Angel. And,
turning to his neighbour, he asked pleasantly:
"How do you do, sir? What is your income?"</p>

<p>The gentleman addressed looked up from his
prawn, and replied wearily: "Ask my agent. He
may conceivably possess the knowledge you require."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
"Answer me this, at all events," said the
Angel, with more dignity, if possible: "How do
you write your books? For it must be wonderful
to summon around you every day the creatures
of your imagination. Do you wait for afflatus?"</p>

<p>"No," said the author; "er&mdash;no! I&mdash;er&mdash;"
he added weightily, "sit down every morning."</p>

<p>The Angel rolled his eyes and, turning to his
dragoman, said in a well-bred whisper: "He sits
down every morning! My Lord, how good for
trade!"</p>


<h3>
<br />
VI</h3>

<p>"A glass of sherry, dry, and ham sandwich,
stale, can be obtained here, sir," said the dragoman;
"and for dessert, the scent of parchment
and bananas. We will then attend Court 45,
where I shall show you how fundamentally our
legal procedure has changed in the generation
that has elapsed since the days of the Great
Skirmish."</p>

<p>"Can it really be that the Law has changed?
I had thought it immutable," said the Angel,
causing his teeth to meet with difficulty: "What
will be the nature of the suit to which we shall
listen?"</p>

<p>"I have thought it best, sir, to select a divorce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
case, lest you should sleep, overcome by the ozone
and eloquence in these places."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Angel: "I am ready."</p>

<p>The Court was crowded, and they took their
seats with difficulty, and a lady sitting on the
Angel's left wing.</p>

<p>"The public <i>will</i> frequent this class of case,"
whispered his dragoman. "How different when
you were here in 1910!"</p>

<p>The Angel collected himself: "Tell me," he
murmured, "which of the grey-haired ones is the
judge?"</p>

<p>"He in the bag-wig, sir," returned his dragoman;
"and that little lot is the jury," he
added, indicating twelve gentlemen seated in
two rows.</p>

<p>"What is their private life?" asked the Angel.</p>

<p>"No better than it should be, perhaps," responded
his dragoman facetiously; "but no one
can tell that from their words and manner, as you
will presently see. These are special ones," he
added, "and pay income tax, so that their judgment
in matters of morality is of considerable
value."</p>

<p>"They have wise faces," said the Angel.
"Which is the prosecutor?"</p>

<p>"No, no!" his dragoman answered, vividly:
"This is a civil case. That is the plaintiff with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
a little mourning about her eyes and a touch of
red about her lips, in the black hat with the
aigrette, the pearls, and the fashionably sober
clothes."</p>

<p>"I see her," said the Angel: "an attractive
woman. Will she win?"</p>

<p>"We do not call it winning, sir; for this, as you
must know, is a sad matter, and implies the breaking-up
of a home. She will most unwillingly receive
a decree, at least, I think so," he added;
"though whether it will stand the scrutiny of the
King's Proctor we may wonder a little, from her
appearance."</p>

<p>"King's Proctor?" said the Angel. "What is
that?"</p>

<p>"A celestial Die-hard, sir, paid to join together
again those whom man have put asunder."</p>

<p>"I do not follow," said the Angel fretfully.</p>

<p>"I perceive," whispered his dragoman, "that I
must make clear to you the spirit which animates
our justice in these matters. You know, of course,
that the intention of our law is ever to penalise
the wrong-doer. It therefore requires the innocent
party, like that lady there, to be exceptionally
innocent, not only before she secures her divorce,
but for six months afterwards."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the Angel. "And where is the
guilty party?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
"Probably in the south of France," returned
his dragoman, "with the new partner of his affections.
They have a place in the sun; this one
a place in the Law Courts."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said the Angel. "Does she prefer
that?"</p>

<p>"There are ladies," his dragoman replied, "who
find it a pleasure to appear, no matter where, so
long as people can see them in a pretty hat. But
the great majority would rather sink into the
earth than do this thing."</p>

<p>"The face of this one is most agreeable to me;
I should not wish her to sink," said the Angel
warmly.</p>

<p>"Agreeable or not," resumed his dragoman,
"they have to bring their hearts for inspection by
the public if they wish to become free from the
party who has done them wrong. This is necessary,
for the penalisation of the wrong-doer."</p>

<p>"And how will he be penalised?" asked the
Angel naïvely.</p>

<p>"By receiving his freedom," returned his dragoman,
"together with the power to enjoy himself
with his new partner, in the sun, until, in due
course, he is able to marry her."</p>

<p>"This is mysterious to me," murmured the
Angel. "Is not the boot on the wrong leg?"</p>

<p>"Oh! sir, the law would not make a mistake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
like that. You are bringing a single mind to the
consideration of this matter, but that will never
do. This lady is a true and much-wronged wife;
that is&mdash;let us hope so!&mdash;to whom our law has
given its protection and remedy; but she is also,
in its eyes, somewhat reprehensible for desiring
to avail herself of that protection and remedy.
For, though the law is now purely the affair of
the State and has nothing to do with the Appointed,
it still secretly believes in the religious
maxim: 'Once married, always married,' and feels
that however much a married person is neglected
or ill-treated, she should not desire to be free."</p>

<p>"She?" said the Angel. "Does a man never
desire to be free?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! sir, and not infrequently."</p>

<p>"Does your law, then, not consider him reprehensible
in that desire?"</p>

<p>"In theory, perhaps; but there is a subtle distinction.
For, sir, as you observe from the
countenances before you, the law is administered
entirely by males, and males cannot but believe
in the divine right of males to have a better
time than females; and, though they do not say
so, they naturally feel that a husband wronged
by a wife is more injured than a wife wronged by
a husband."</p>

<p>"There is much in that," said the Angel. "But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
tell me how the oracle is worked&mdash;for it may come
in handy!"</p>

<p>"You allude, sir, to the necessary procedure?
I will make this clear. There are two kinds of
cases: what I may call the 'O.K.' and what I
may call the 'rig.' Now in the 'O.K.' it is only
necessary for the plaintiff, if it be a woman, to
receive a black eye from her husband and to
pay detectives to find out that he has been too
closely in the company of another; if it be a man,
he need not receive a black eye from his wife,
and has merely to pay the detectives to obtain
the same necessary information."</p>

<p>"Why this difference between the sexes?"
asked the Angel.</p>

<p>"Because," answered his dragoman, "woman is
the weaker sex, things are therefore harder for
her."</p>

<p>"But," said the Angel, "the English have a
reputation for chivalry."</p>

<p>"They have, sir."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;&mdash;" began the Angel.</p>

<p>"When these conditions are complied with,"
interrupted his dragoman, "a suit for divorce
may be brought, which may or may not be defended.
Now, the 'rig,' which is always brought
by the wife, is not so simple, for it must be subdivided
into two sections: 'Ye straight rig' and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
'Ye crooked rig.' 'Ye straight rig' is where the
wife cannot induce her husband to remain with
her, and discovering from him that he has been
in the close company of another, wishes to be
free of him. She therefore tells the Court that
she wishes him to come back to her, and the
Court will tell him to go back. Whereon, if he
obey, the fat is sometimes in the fire. If, however,
he obeys not, which is the more probable, she may,
after a short delay, bring a suit, adducing the
evidence she has obtained, and receive a decree.
This may be the case before you, or, on the other
hand, it may not, and will then be what is called
'Ye crooked rig.' If that is so, these two persons,
having found that they cannot live in conjugal
friendliness, have laid their heads together
for the last time, and arranged to part; the procedure
will now be the same as in 'Ye straight
rig.' But the wife must take the greatest care to
lead the Court to suppose that she really wishes
her husband to come back; for, if she does not,
it is collusion. The more ardent her desire to
part from him, the more care she must take to
pretend the opposite! But this sort of case is,
after all, the simplest, for both parties are in
complete accord in desiring to be free of each
other, so neither does anything to retard that
end, which is soon obtained."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
"About that evidence?" said the Angel. "What
must the man do?"</p>

<p>"He will require to go to an hotel with a lady
friend," replied his dragoman; "once will be
enough. And, provided they are called in the
morning, there is no real necessity for anything
else."</p>

<p>"H'm!" said the Angel. "This, indeed, seems
to me to be all around about the bush. Could
there not be some simple method which would
not necessitate the perversion of the truth?"</p>

<p>"Ah, no!" responded his dragoman. "You
forget what I told you, sir. However unhappy
people may be together, our law grudges their
separation; it requires them therefore to be immoral,
or to lie, or both, before they can part."</p>

<p>"Curious!" said the Angel.</p>

<p>"You must understand, sir, that when a man
says he will take a woman, and a woman says she
will take a man, for the rest of their natural existence,
they are assumed to know all about each
other, though not permitted, of course, by the
laws of morality to know anything of real importance.
Since it is almost impossible from a
modest acquaintanceship to make sure whether
they will continue to desire each other's company
after a completed knowledge, they are naturally
disposed to go it 'blind,' if I may be pardoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
the expression, and will take each other for ever
on the smallest provocations. For the human
being, sir, makes nothing of the words 'for ever,'
when it sees immediate happiness before it. You
can well understand, therefore, how necessary it
is to make it very hard for them to get untied
again."</p>

<p>"I should dislike living with a wife if I were
tired of her," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"Sir," returned his dragoman confidentially,
"in that sentiment you would have with you the
whole male population. And, I believe, the
whole of the female population would feel the
same if they were tired of you, as the husband."</p>

<p>"That!" said the Angel, with a quiet smile.</p>

<p>"Ah! yes, sir; but does not this convince you
of the necessity to force people who are tired of
each other to go on living together?"</p>

<p>"No," said the Angel, with appalling frankness.</p>

<p>"Well," his dragoman replied soberly, "I must
admit that some have thought our marriage laws
should be in a museum, for they are unique; and,
though a source of amusement to the public, and
emolument to the profession, they pass the comprehension
of men and angels who have not the
key of the mystery."</p>

<p>"What key?" asked the Angel.</p>

<p>"I will give it you, sir," said his dragoman:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
"The English have a genius for taking the shadow
of a thing for its substance. 'So long,' they say,
'as our marriages, our virtue, our honesty, and
happiness <i>seem</i> to be, they <i>are</i>.' So long, therefore,
as we do not dissolve a marriage it remains
virtuous, honest and happy though the parties
to it may be unfaithful, untruthful, and in misery.
It would be regarded as awful, sir, for marriage to
depend on mutual liking. We English cannot
bear the thought of defeat. To dissolve an unhappy
marriage is to recognise defeat by life,
and we would rather that other people lived in
wretchedness all their days than admit that members
of our race had come up against something
too hard to overcome. The English do not care
about making the best out of this life in reality so
long as they can do it in appearance."</p>

<p>"Then they believe in a future life?"</p>

<p>"They did to some considerable extent up to
the 'eighties of the last century, and their laws
and customs were no doubt settled in accordance
therewith, and have not yet had time to adapt
themselves. We are a somewhat slow-moving
people, always a generation or two behind our
real beliefs."</p>

<p>"They have lost their belief, then?"</p>

<p>"It is difficult to arrive at figures, sir, on such
a question. But it has been estimated that perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
one in ten adults now has some semblance
of what may be called active belief in a future
existence."</p>

<p>"And the rest are prepared to let their lives be
arranged in accordance with the belief of that
tenth?" asked the Angel, surprised. "Tell me,
do they think their matrimonial differences will
be adjusted over there, or what?"</p>

<p>"As to that, all is cloudy; and certain matters
would be difficult to adjust without bigamy; for
general opinion and the law permit the remarriage
of persons whose first has gone before."</p>

<p>"How about children?" said the Angel; "for
that is no inconsiderable item, I imagine."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, they are a difficulty. But here,
again, my key will fit. So long as the marriage
<i>seems</i> real, it does not matter that the children
know it isn't and suffer from the disharmony of
their parents."</p>

<p>"I think," said the Angel acutely, "there must
be some more earthly reason for the condition of
your marriage laws than those you give me. It's
all a matter of property at bottom, I suspect."</p>

<p>"Sir," said his dragoman, seemingly much
struck, "I should not be surprised if you were
right. There is little interest in divorce where no
money is involved, and our poor are considered
able to do without it. But I will never admit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
that this is the reason for the state of our divorce
laws. No, no; I am an Englishman."</p>

<p>"Well," said the Angel, "we are wandering.
Does this judge believe what they are now saying
to him?"</p>

<p>"It is impossible to inform you, for judges are
very deep and know all that is to be known on
these matters. But of this you may be certain:
if anything is fishy to the average apprehension,
he will not suffer it to pass his nose."</p>

<p>"Where is the average apprehension?" asked
the Angel.</p>

<p>"There, sir," said his dragoman, pointing to
the jury with his chin, "noted for their common
sense."</p>

<p>"And these others with grey heads who are
calling each other friend, though they appear to
be inimical?"</p>

<p>"Little can be hid from them," returned his
dragoman; "but this case, though defended as to
certain matters of money, is not disputed in regard
to the divorce itself. Moreover, they are
bound by professional etiquette to serve their
clients through thin and thick."</p>

<p>"Cease!" said the Angel; "I wish to hear this
evidence, and so does the lady on my left wing."</p>

<p>His dragoman smiled in his beard, and made no
answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
"Tell me," remarked the Angel, when he had
listened, "does this woman get anything for saying
she called them in the morning?"</p>

<p>"Fie, sir!" responded his dragoman; "only her
expenses to the Court and back. Though indeed,
it is possible that after she had called them, she
got half a sovereign from the defendant to impress
the matter on her mind, seeing that she
calls many people every day."</p>

<p>"The whole matter," said the Angel with a
frown, "appears to be in the nature of a game;
nor are the details as savoury as I expected."</p>

<p>"It would be otherwise if the case were defended,
sir," returned his dragoman; "then, too,
you would have had an opportunity of understanding
the capacity of the human mind for
seeing the same incident to be both black and
white; but it would take much of your valuable
time, and the Court would be so crowded that
you would have a lady sitting on your right wing
also, and possibly on your knee. For, as you observe,
ladies are particularly attached to these
dramas of real life."</p>

<p>"If my wife were a wrong one," said the Angel,
"I suppose that, according to your law, I could
not sew her up in a sack and place it in the water?"</p>

<p>"We are not now in the days of the Great
Skirmish," replied his dragoman somewhat coldly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
"At that time any soldier who found his wife
unfaithful, as we call it, could shoot her with
impunity and receive the plaudits and possibly a
presentation from the populace, though he himself
may not have been impeccable while away&mdash;a
masterly method of securing a divorce. But,
as I told you, our procedure has changed since
then; and even soldiers now have to go to work
in this roundabout fashion."</p>

<p>"Can he not shoot the paramour?" asked the
Angel.</p>

<p>"Not even that," answered his dragoman.
"So soft and degenerate are the days. Though,
if he can invent for the paramour a German name,
he will still receive but a nominal sentence. Our
law is renowned for never being swayed by sentimental
reasons. I well recollect a case in the
days of the Great Skirmish, when a jury found
contrary to the plainest facts sooner than allow
that reputation for impartiality to be tarnished."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Angel absently; "what is happening
now?"</p>

<p>"The jury are considering their verdict. The
conclusion is, however, foregone, for they are not
retiring. The plaintiff is now using her smelling
salts."</p>

<p>"She is a fine woman," said the Angel emphatically.<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hush, sir! The judge might hear you."</p>

<p>"What if he does?" asked the Angel in surprise.</p>

<p>"He would then eject you for contempt of
Court."</p>

<p>"Does he not think her a fine woman, too?"</p>

<p>"For the love of justice, sir, be silent," entreated
his dragoman. "This concerns the happiness
of three, if not of five lives. Look! She
is lifting her veil; she is going to use her handkerchief."</p>

<p>"I cannot bear to see a woman cry," said the
Angel, trying to rise; "please take this lady off
my left wing."</p>

<p>"Kindly sit tight!" murmured his dragoman to
the lady, leaning across behind the Angel's back.
"Listen, sir!" he added to the Angel: "The jury
are satisfied that what is necessary has taken
place. All is well; she will get her decree."</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" said the Angel in a loud voice.</p>

<p>"If that noise is repeated, I will have the Court
cleared."</p>

<p>"I am going to repeat it," said the Angel
firmly; "she is beautiful!"</p>

<p>His dragoman placed a hand respectfully over
the Angel's mouth. "Oh, sir!" he said soothingly,
"do not spoil this charming moment.
Hark! He is giving her a decree <i>nisi</i>, with costs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
To-morrow it will be in all the papers, for it helps
to sell them. See! She is withdrawing; we can
now go." And he disengaged the Angel's wing.</p>

<p>The Angel rose quickly and made his way towards
the door. "I am going to walk out with
her," he announced joyously.</p>

<p>"I beseech you," said his dragoman, hurrying
beside him, "remember the King's Proctor!
Where is your chivalry? For <i>he</i> has none, sir&mdash;not
a little bit!"</p>

<p>"Bring him to me; I will give it him!" said
the Angel, kissing the tips of his fingers to the
plaintiff, who was vanishing in the gloom of the
fresh air.</p>


<h3>
<br />
VII</h3>

<p>In the Strangers' room of the Strangers' Club
the usual solitude was reigning when the Angel
Æthereal entered.</p>

<p>"You will be quiet here," said his dragoman,
drawing up two leather chairs to the hearth, "and
comfortable," he added, as the Angel crossed his
legs. "After our recent experience, I thought it
better to bring you where your mind would be
composed, since we have to consider so important
a subject as morality. There is no place, indeed,
where we could be so completely sheltered from
life, or so free to evolve from our inner consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
the momentous conclusions of the armchair
moralist. When you have had your sneeze," he
added, glancing at the Angel, who was taking
snuff, "I shall make known to you the conclusions I
have formed in the course of a chequered career."</p>

<p>"Before you do that," said the Angel, "it
would perhaps be as well to limit the sphere of
our inquiry."</p>

<p>"As to that," remarked his dragoman, "I shall
confine my information to the morals of the English
since the opening of the Great Skirmish, in
1914, just a short generation of three and thirty
years ago; and you will find my theme readily
falls, sir, into the two main compartments of
public and private morality. When I have finished
you can ask me any questions."</p>

<p>"Proceed!" said the Angel, letting his eyelids
droop.</p>

<p>"Public morality," his dragoman began, "is
either superlative, comparative, positive, or negative.
And superlative morality is found, of course,
only in the newspapers. It is the special prerogative
of leader-writers. Its note, remote and
unchallengeable, was well struck by almost every
organ at the commencement of the Great Skirmish,
and may be summed up in a single solemn
phrase: 'We will sacrifice on the altar of duty the
last life and the last dollar&mdash;except the last life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
and dollar of the last leader-writer.' For, as all
must see, that one had to be preserved, to ensure
and comment on the consummation of the sacrifice.
What loftier morality can be conceived?
And it has ever been a grief to the multitude that
the lives of those patriots and benefactors of their
species should, through modesty, have been unrevealed
to such as pant to copy them. Here and
there the lineaments of a tip-topper were discernible
beneath the disguise of custom; but
what fair existences were screened! I may tell
you at once, sir, that the State was so much
struck at the time of the Great Skirmish by this
doctrine of the utter sacrifice of others that it
almost immediately adopted the idea, and has
struggled to retain it ever since. Indeed, only
the unaccountable reluctance of 'others' to be
utterly sacrificed has ensured their perpetuity."</p>

<p>"In 1910," said the Angel, "I happened to notice
that the Prussians had already perfected that
system. Yet it was against the Prussians that
this country fought?"</p>

<p>"That is so," returned his dragoman; "there
were many who drew attention to the fact. And
at the conclusion of the Great Skirmish the reaction
was such that for a long moment even the
leader-writers wavered in their selfless doctrines;
nor could continuity be secured till the Laborious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
Party came solidly to the saddle in 1930. Since
then the principle has been firm but the practice
has been firmer, and public morality has never
been altogether superlative. Let us pass to comparative
public morality. In the days of the
Great Skirmish this was practised by those with
names, who told others what to do. This large
and capable body included all the preachers, publicists,
and politicians of the day, and in many
cases there is even evidence that they would have
been willing to practise what they preached if
their age had not been so venerable or their directive
power so invaluable."</p>

<p>"<i>In</i>-valuable," murmured the Angel; "has that
word a negative signification?"</p>

<p>"Not in all cases," said his dragoman with a
smile; "there were men whom it would have been
difficult to replace, though not many, and those
perhaps the least comparatively moral. In this
category, too, were undoubtedly the persons
known as conchies."</p>

<p>"From conch, a shell?" asked the Angel.</p>

<p>"Not precisely," returned his dragoman; "and
yet you have hit it, sir, for into their shells they
certainly withdrew, refusing to have anything to
do with this wicked world. Sufficient unto them
was the voice within. They were not well treated
by an unfeeling populace."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
"This is interesting to me," said the Angel.
"To what did they object?"</p>

<p>"To war," replied his dragoman. "'What is it
to us,' they said, 'that there should be barbarians
like these Prussians, who override the laws of
justice and humanity?'&mdash;words, sir, very much
in vogue in those days. 'How can it affect our
principles if these rude foreigners have not our
views, and are prepared, by cutting off the food
supplies of this island, to starve us into submission
to their rule? Rather than turn a deaf ear
to the voice within we are prepared for general
starvation; whether we are prepared for the
starvation of our individual selves we cannot, of
course, say until we experience it. But we hope
for the best, and believe that we shall go through
with it to death, in the undesired company of all
who do not agree with us.' And it is certain, sir,
that some of them were capable of this; for there
is, as you know, a type of man who will die rather
than admit that his views are too extreme to keep
himself and his fellow-men alive."</p>

<p>"How entertaining!" said the Angel. "Do
such persons still exist?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes," replied the dragoman; "and always
will. Nor is it, in my opinion, altogether to
the disadvantage of mankind, for they afford a
salutary warning to the human species not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
isolate itself in fancy from the realities of existence
and extinguish human life before its time
has come. We shall now consider the positively
moral. At the time of the Great Skirmish these
were such as took no sugar in their tea and invested
all they had in War Stock at five per cent.
without waiting for what were called Premium
Bonds to be issued. They were a large and
healthy group, more immediately concerned with
commerce than the war. But the largest body of
all were the negatively moral. These were they
who did what they crudely called 'their bit,'
which I may tell you, sir, was often very bitter.
I myself was a ship's steward at the time, and
frequently swallowed much salt water, owing to
the submarines. But I was not to be deterred,
and would sign on again when it had been pumped
out of me. Our morality was purely negative, if
not actually low. We acted, as it were, from instinct,
and often wondered at the sublime sacrifices
which were being made by our betters.
Most of us were killed or injured in one way or
another; but a blind and obstinate mania for not
giving in possessed us. We were a simple lot."
The dragoman paused and fixed his eyes on the
empty hearth. "I will not disguise from you," he
added, "that we were fed-up nearly all the time;
and yet&mdash;we couldn't stop. Odd, was it not?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
"I wish I had been with you," said the Angel,
"for&mdash;to use that word without which you English
seem unable to express anything&mdash;you were
heroes."</p>

<p>"Sir," said his dragoman, "you flatter us by
such encomium. We were, I fear, dismally lacking
in commercial spirit, just men and women in
the street having neither time nor inclination to
examine our conduct and motives, nor to question
or direct the conduct of others. Purely
negative beings, with perhaps a touch of human
courage and human kindliness in us. All this,
however, is a tale of long ago. You can now ask
me any questions, sir, before I pass to private
morality."</p>

<p>"You alluded to courage and kindliness," said
the Angel: "How do these qualities now stand?"</p>

<p>"The quality of courage," responded his dragoman,
"received a set-back in men's estimation at
the time of the Great Skirmish, from which it has
never properly recovered. For physical courage
was then, for the first time, perceived to be most
excessively common; it is, indeed, probably a
mere attribute of the bony chin, especially prevalent
in the English-speaking races. As to moral
courage, it was so hunted down that it is still
somewhat in hiding. Of kindliness there are, as
you know, two sorts: that which people manifest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
towards their own belongings; and that which
they do not as a rule manifest towards every one
else."</p>

<p>"Since we attended the Divorce Court," remarked
the Angel with deliberation, "I have
been thinking. And I fancy no one can be really
kind unless they have had matrimonial trouble,
preferably in conflict with the law."</p>

<p>"A new thought to me," observed his dragoman
attentively; "and yet you may be right, for
there is nothing like being morally outcast to
make you feel the intolerance of others. But
that brings us to private morality."</p>

<p>"Quite!" said the Angel, with relief. "I forgot
to ask you this morning how the ancient custom
of marriage was now regarded in the large?"</p>

<p>"Not indeed as a sacrament," replied his dragoman;
"such a view was becoming rare already at
the time of the Great Skirmish. Yet the notion
might have been preserved but for the opposition
of the Pontifical of those days to the reform of the
Divorce Laws. When principle opposes common
sense too long, a landslide follows."</p>

<p>"Of what nature, then, is marriage now?"</p>

<p>"Purely a civil, or uncivil, contract, as the case
may be. The holy state of judicial separation,
too, has long been unknown."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Angel, "that was the custom by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
which the man became a monk and the lady a
nun, was it not?"</p>

<p>"In theory, sir," replied his dragoman, "but in
practice not a little bit, as you may well suppose.
The Pontifical, however, and the women, old and
otherwise, who supported them, had but small experience
of life to go on, and honestly believed
that they were punishing those still-married but
erring persons who were thus separated. These,
on the contrary, almost invariably assumed that
they were justified in free companionships, nor
were they particular to avoid promiscuity! So
it ever is, sir, when the great laws of Nature are
violated in deference to the Higher Doctrine."</p>

<p>"Are children still born out of wedlock?" asked
the Angel.</p>

<p>"Yes," said his dragoman, "but no longer considered
responsible for the past conduct of their
parents."</p>

<p>"Society, then, is more humane?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, we shall not see the Millennium in
that respect for some years to come. Zoos are
still permitted, and I read only yesterday a letter
from a Scottish gentleman pouring scorn on the
humane proposal that prisoners should be allowed
to see their wives once a month without
bars or the presence of a third party; precisely as
if we still lived in the days of the Great Skirmish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
Can you tell me why it is that such letters are always
written by Scotsmen?"</p>

<p>"Is it a riddle?" asked the Angel.</p>

<p>"It is indeed, sir."</p>

<p>"Then it bores me. Speaking generally, are
you satisfied with current virtue now that it is a
State matter, as you informed me yesterday?"</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, sir, I do not judge my
neighbours; sufficient unto myself is the vice
thereof. But one thing I observe, the less virtuous
people assume themselves to be, the more
virtuous they commonly are. Where the limelight
is not, the flower blooms. Have you not
frequently noticed that they who day by day
cheerfully endure most unpleasant things, while
helping their neighbours at the expense of their
own time and goods, are often rendered lyrical by
receiving a sovereign from some one who would
never miss it, and are ready to enthrone him in
their hearts as a king of men? The truest virtue,
sir, must be sought among the lowly. Sugar and
snow may be seen on the top, but for the salt of
the earth one must look to the bottom."</p>

<p>"I believe you," said the Angel. "It is probably
harder for a man in the limelight to enter
virtue than for the virtuous to enter the limelight.
Ha, ha! Is the good old custom of buying
honour still preserved?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
"No, sir; honour is now only given to such as
make themselves too noisy to be endured, and
saddles the recipient with an obligation to preserve
public silence for a period not exceeding
three years. That maximum sentence is given
for a dukedom. It is reckoned that few can survive
so fearful a term."</p>

<p>"Concerning the morality of this new custom,"
said the Angel, "I feel doubtful. It savours of
surrender to the bully and the braggart, does it
not?"</p>

<p>"Rather to the bore, sir; not necessarily the
same thing. But whether men be decorated for
making themselves useful, or troublesome, the
result in either case is to secure a comparative
inertia, which has ever been the desideratum;
for you must surely be aware, sir, how a man's
dignity weighs him down."</p>

<p>"Are women also rewarded in this way?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and very often; for although their dignity
is already ample, their tongues are long, and
they have little shame and no nerves in the matter
of public speaking."</p>

<p>"And what price their virtue?" asked the Angel.</p>

<p>"There is some change since the days of the
Great Skirmish," responded his dragoman. "They
do not now so readily sell it, except for a wedding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
ring; and many marry for love. Women, indeed,
are often deplorably lacking in commercial spirit;
and though they now mix in commerce, have not
yet been able to adapt themselves. Some men
even go so far as to think that their participation
in active life is not good for trade and keeps the
country back."</p>

<p>"They are a curious sex," said the Angel; "I
like them, but they make too much fuss about
babies."</p>

<p>"Ah! sir, there is the great flaw. The mother
instinct&mdash;so heedless and uncommercial! They
seem to love the things just for their own sakes."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Angel, "there's no future in it.
Give me a cigar."</p>


<h3>
<br />
VIII</h3>

<p>"What, then, is the present position of 'the
good'?" asked the Angel Æthereal, taking wing
from Watchester Cathedrome towards the City
Tabernacle.</p>

<p>"There are a number of discordant views, sir,"
his dragoman whiffled through his nose in the
rushing air; "which is no more novel in this year
of Peace 1947 than it was when you were here in
1910. On the far right are certain extremists,
who believe it to be what it was&mdash;omnipotent, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
suffering the presence of 'the bad' for no reason
which has yet been ascertained; omnipresent,
though presumably absent where 'the bad' is
present; mysterious, though perfectly revealed;
terrible, though loving; eternal, though limited
by a beginning and an end. They are not numerous,
but all stall-holders, and chiefly characterised
by an almost perfect intolerance of those
whose views do not coincide with their own; nor
will they suffer for a moment any examination
into the nature of 'the good,' which they hold to
be established for all time, in the form I have
stated, by persons who have long been dead.
They are, as you may imagine, somewhat out of
touch with science, such as it is, and are regarded
by the community at large rather with
curiosity than anything else."</p>

<p>"The type is well known in the sky," said the
Angel. "Tell me: Do they torture those who do
not agree with them?"</p>

<p>"Not materially," responded his dragoman.
"Such a custom was extinct even before the days
of the Great Skirmish, though what would have
happened if the Patriotic or Prussian Party had
been able to keep power for any length of time
we cannot tell. As it is, the torture they apply
is purely spiritual, and consists in looking down
their noses at all who have not their belief and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
calling them erratics. But it would be a mistake
to underrate their power, for human nature
loves the Pontifical, and there are those who will
follow to the death any one who looks down his
nose, and says: 'I know!' Moreover, sir, consider
how unsettling a question 'the good' is, when
you come to think about it and how unfatiguing
the faith which precludes all such speculation."</p>

<p>"That is so," said the Angel thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"The right centre," continued his dragoman,
"is occupied by the small yet noisy Fifth Party.
These are they who play the cornet and tambourine,
big drum and concertina, descendants of the
Old Prophet, and survivors of those who, following
a younger prophet, joined them at the time
of the Great Skirmish. In a form ever modifying
with scientific discovery they hold that 'the
good' is a superman, bodiless yet bodily, with a
beginning but without an end. It is an attractive
faith, enabling them to say to Nature: '<i>Je
m'en fiche de tout cela.</i> My big brother will look
after me Pom!' One may call it anthropomorphia,
for it seems especially soothing to strong
personalities. Every man to his creed, as they
say; and I would never wish to throw cold water
on such as seek to find 'the good' by closing one
eye instead of two, as is done by the extremists
on the right."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
"You are tolerant," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"Sir," said his dragoman, "as one gets older,
one perceives more and more how impossible it
is for man not to regard himself as the cause of
the universe, and for certain individual men not
to believe themselves the centre of the cause.
For such to start a new belief is a biological necessity,
and should by no means be discouraged. It
is a safety-valve&mdash;the form of passion which the
fires of youth take in men after the age of fifty,
as one may judge by the case of the prophet
Tolstoy and other great ones. But to resume: In
the centre, of course, are situated the enormous
majority of the community, whose view is that
they have no view of what 'the good' is."</p>

<p>"None?" repeated the Angel Æthereal, somewhat
struck.</p>

<p>"Not the faintest," answered his dragoman.
"These are the only true mystics; for what is a
mystic if not one with an impenetrable belief in
the mystery of his own existence? This group
embraces the great bulk of the Laborious. It is
true that many of them will repeat what is told
them of 'the good' as if it were their own view,
without compunction, but this is no more than
the majority of persons have done from the beginning
of time."</p>

<p>"Quite," admitted the Angel; "I have observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
that phenomenon in the course of my travels. We
will not waste words on them."</p>

<p>"Ah, sir!" retorted his dragoman, "there is
more wisdom in these persons than you imagine.
For, consider what would be the fate of their
brains if they attempted to think for themselves.
Moreover, as you know, all definite views about
'the good' are very wearing, and it is better, so
this great majority thinks, to let sleeping dogs
lie than to have them barking in its head. But I
will tell you something," the dragoman added:
"These innumerable persons have a secret belief
of their own, old as the Greeks, that good fellowship
is all that matters. And, in my opinion,
taking 'the good' in its limited sense, it is an admirable
creed."</p>

<p>"Oh! cut on!" said the Angel.</p>

<p>"My mistake, sir!" said his dragoman. "On
the left centre are grouped that increasing section
whose view is that since everything is very bad,
'the good' is ultimate extinction&mdash;'Peace, perfect
peace,' as the poet says. You will recollect
the old tag: 'To be or not to be.' These are they
who have answered that question in the negative;
pessimists masquerading to an unsuspecting
public as optimists. They are no doubt descendants
of such as used to be called 'Theosophians,'
a sect which presupposed everything and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
then desired to be annihilated; or, again, of the
Christian Scientites, who simply could not bear
things as they were, so set themselves to think
they were not, with some limited amount of success,
if I remember rightly. I recall to mind the
case of a lady who lost her virtue, and recovered
it by dint of remembering that she had no
body."</p>

<p>"Curious!" said the Angel. "I should like to
question her; let me have her address after the
lecture. Does the theory of reincarnation still
obtain?"</p>

<p>"I do not wonder, sir, that you are interested
in the point, for believers in that doctrine are
compelled, by the old and awkward rule that
'Two and two make four,' to draw on other
spheres for the reincarnation of their spirits."</p>

<p>"I do not follow," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"It is simple, however," answered his dragoman,
"for at one time on earth, as is admitted,
there was no life. The first incarnation, therefore&mdash;an
am&oelig;ba, we used to be told&mdash;enclosed a
spirit, possibly from above. It may, indeed, have
been yours, sir. Again, at some time on this
earth, as is admitted, there will again be no life;
the last spirit will therefore flit to an incarnation,
possibly below; and again, sir, who knows, it may
be yours."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
"I cannot jest on such a subject," said the Angel,
with a sneeze.</p>

<p>"No offence," murmured his dragoman. "The
last group, on the far left, to which indeed I myself
am not altogether unaffiliated, is composed
of a small number of extremists, who hold that
'the good' is things as they are&mdash;pardon the inevitable
flaw in grammar. They consider that
what is now has always been, and will always be;
that things do but swell and contract and swell
again, and so on for ever and ever; and that,
since they could not swell if they did not contract,
since without the black there could not be the
white, nor pleasure without pain, nor virtue without
vice, nor criminals without judges; even contraction,
or the black, or pain, or vice, or judges,
are not 'the bad,' but only negatives; and that
all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds.
They are Voltairean optimists masquerading to
an unsuspecting population as pessimists. 'Eternal
Variation' is their motto."</p>

<p>"I gather," said the Angel, "that these think
there is no purpose in existence?"</p>

<p>"Rather, sir, that existence <i>is</i> the purpose.
For, if you consider, any other conception of
purpose implies fulfilment, or an <i>end</i>, which they
do not admit, just as they do not admit a beginning."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
"How logical!" said the Angel. "It makes me
dizzy! You have renounced the idea of climbing,
then?"</p>

<p>"Not so," responded his dragoman. "We
climb to the top of the pole, slide imperceptibly
down, and begin over again; but since we never
really know whether we are climbing or sliding,
this does not depress us."</p>

<p>"To believe that this goes on for ever is futile,"
said the Angel.</p>

<p>"So we are told," replied his dragoman, without
emotion. "<i>We</i> think, however, that the truth
is with us, in spite of jesting Pilate."</p>

<p>"It is not for me," said the Angel, with dignity,
"to argue with my dragoman."</p>

<p>"No, sir, for it is always necessary to beware of
the open mind. I myself find it very difficult to
believe the same thing every day. And the fact
is that whatever you believe will probably not
alter the truth, which may be said to have a
certain mysterious immutability, considering the
number of efforts men have made to change it
from time to time. We are now, however, just
above the City Tabernacle, and if you will close
your wings we shall penetrate it through the
clap-trap-door which enables its preachers now
and then to ascend to higher spheres."</p>

<p>"Stay!" said the Angel; "let me float a minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
while I suck a peppermint, for the audiences in
these places often have colds." And with that
delicious aroma clinging to them they made their
entry through a strait gate in the roof and took
their seats in the front row, below a tall prophet
in eyeglasses, who was discoursing on the stars.
The Angel slept heavily.</p>

<p>"You have lost a good thing, sir," said his
dragoman reproachfully, when they left the
Tabernacle.</p>

<p>"In my opinion," the Angel playfully responded,
"I won a better, for I went nap. What
can a mortal know about the stars?"</p>

<p>"Believe me," answered his dragoman, "the
subject is not more abstruse than is generally
chosen."</p>

<p>"If he had taken religion I should have listened
with pleasure," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"Oh! sir, but in these days such a subject is
unknown in a place of worship. Religion is now
exclusively a State affair. The change began
with discipline and the Education Bill in 1918,
and has gradually crystallised ever since. It is
true that individual extremists on the right make
continual endeavours to encroach on the functions
of the State, but they preach to empty
houses."</p>

<p>"And the Deity?" said the Angel: "You have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
not once mentioned Him. It has struck me as
curious."</p>

<p>"Belief in the Deity," responded his dragoman,
"perished shortly after the Great Skirmish, during
which there was too active and varied an
effort to revive it. Action, as you know, sir, always
brings reaction, and it must be said that the
spiritual propaganda of those days was so grossly
tinged with the commercial spirit that it came
under the head of profiteering and earned for
itself a certain abhorrence. For no sooner had
the fears and griefs brought by the Great Skirmish
faded from men's spirits than they perceived
that their new impetus towards the Deity had
been directed purely by the longing for protection,
solace, comfort, and reward, and not by any
real desire for 'the good' in itself. It was this
truth, together with the appropriation of the
word by Emperors, and the expansion of our
towns, a process ever destructive of traditions,
which brought about extinction of belief in His
existence."</p>

<p>"It was a large order," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"It was more a change of nomenclature," replied
his dragoman. "The ruling motive for belief
in 'the good' is still the hope of getting something
out of it&mdash;the commercial spirit is innate."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Angel, absently. "Can we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
another lunch now? I could do with a slice of
beef."</p>

<p>"An admirable idea, sir," replied his dragoman;
"we will have it in the White City."</p>


<h3>
<br />
IX</h3>

<p>"What in your opinion is the nature of happiness?"
asked the Angel Æthereal, as he finished
his second bottle of Bass, in the grounds of
the White City. The dragoman regarded his
angel with one eye.</p>

<p>"The question is not simple, sir, though often
made the subject of symposiums in the more intellectual
journals. Even now, in the middle of
the twentieth century, some still hold that it is a
by-product of fresh air and good liquor. The
Old and Merrie England indubitably procured
it from those elements. Some, again, imagine it
to follow from high thinking and low living, while
no mean number believe that it depends on
women."</p>

<p>"Their absence or their presence?" asked the
Angel, with interest.</p>

<p>"Some this and others that. But for my part,
it is not altogether the outcome of these causes."</p>

<p>"Is this now a happy land?"</p>

<p>"Sir," returned his dragoman, "all things
earthly are comparative."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
"Get on with it," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"I will comply," responded his dragoman reproachfully,
"if you will permit me first to draw
your third cork. And let me say in passing that
even your present happiness is comparative, or
possibly superlative, as you will know when you
have finished this last bottle. It may or may not
be greater; we shall see."</p>

<p>"We shall," said the Angel, resolutely.</p>

<p>"You ask me whether this land is happy; but
must we not first decide what happiness is? And
how difficult this will be you shall soon discover.
For example, in the early days of the Great Skirmish,
happiness was reputed non-existent; every
family was plunged into anxiety or mourning;
and, though this to my own knowledge was not
the case, such as were not pretended to be. Yet,
strange as it may appear, the shrewd observer of
those days was unable to remark any indication
of added gloom. Certain creature comforts, no
doubt, were scarce, but there was no lack of
spiritual comfort, which high minds have ever
associated with happiness; nor do I here allude to
liquor. What, then, was the nature of this spiritual
comfort, you will certainly be asking. I will
tell you, and in seven words: People forgot themselves
and remembered other people. Until those
days it had never been realised what a lot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
medical men could be spared from the civil
population; what a number of clergymen, lawyers,
stockbrokers, artists, writers, politicians, and
other persons, whose work in life is to cause people
to think about themselves, never would be
missed. Invalids knitted socks and forgot to be
unwell; old gentlemen read the papers and forgot
to talk about their food; people travelled in trains
and forgot not to fall into conversation with each
other; merchants became special constables and
forgot to differ about property; the House of
Lords remembered its dignity and forgot its impudence;
the House of Commons almost forgot
to chatter. The case of the working man was the
most striking of all&mdash;he forgot he was the working
man. The very dogs forgot themselves, though
that, to be sure, was no novelty, as the Irish
writer demonstrated in his terrific outburst: 'On
my doorstep.' But time went on, and hens in
their turn forgot to lay, ships to return to port,
cows to give enough milk, and Governments to
look ahead, till the first flush of self-forgetfulness
which had dyed peoples' cheeks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Died on them," put in the Angel, with a quiet
smile.</p>

<p>"You take my meaning, sir," said his dragoman,
"though I should not have worded it so
happily. But certainly the return to self began,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
and people used to think: 'This war is not so
bloody as I thought, for I am getting better
money than I ever did, and the longer it lasts the
more I shall get, and for the sake of this I am
prepared to endure much.' The saying "Beef
and beer, for soon you must put up the shutters,"
became the motto of all classes. 'If I am to be
shot, drowned, bombed, ruined, or starved to-morrow,'
they said, 'I had better eat, drink,
marry, and buy jewelry to-day.' And so they
did, in spite of the dreadful efforts of one bishop
and two gentlemen who presided over the important
question of food. They did not, it is true,
relax their manual efforts to accomplish the defeat
of their enemies, or 'win the war,' as it was
somewhat loosely called; but they no longer
worked with their spirits, which, with a few exceptions,
went to sleep. For, sir, the spirit, like
the body, demands regular repose, and in my
opinion is usually the first of the two to snore.
Before the Great Skirmish came at last to its
appointed end the snoring from spirits in this
country might have been heard in the moon.
People thought of little but money, revenge, and
what they could get to eat, though the word
'sacrifice' was so accustomed to their lips that
they could no more get it off them than the other
forms of lip-salve, increasingly in vogue. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
became very merry. And the question I would
raise is this: By which of these two standards
shall we assess the word 'happiness'? Were these
people happy when they mourned and thought
not of self; or when they merried and thought of
self all the time?"</p>

<p>"By the first standard," replied the Angel, with
kindling eyes. "Happiness is undoubtedly nobility."</p>

<p>"Not so fast, sir," replied his dragoman; "for I
have frequently met with nobility in distress;
and, indeed, the more exalted and refined the
mind, the unhappier is frequently the owner
thereof, for to him are visible a thousand cruelties
and mean injustices which lower natures do not
perceive."</p>

<p>"Hold!" exclaimed the Angel: "This is blasphemy
against Olympus, 'The Spectator,' and
other High-Brows."</p>

<p>"Sir," replied his dragoman gravely, "I am
not one of those who accept gilded doctrines without
examination; I read in the Book of Life rather
than in the million tomes written by men to get
away from their own unhappiness."</p>

<p>"I perceive," said the Angel, with a shrewd
glance, "that you have something up your sleeve.
Shake it out!"</p>

<p>"My conclusion is this, sir," returned his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
dragoman, well pleased: "Man is only happy
when he is living at a certain pressure of life to
the square inch; in other words, when he is so
absorbed in what he is doing, making, saying,
thinking, or dreaming, that he has lost self-consciousness.
If there be upon him any ill&mdash;such as
toothache or moody meditation&mdash;so poignant as
to prevent him losing himself in the interest of
the moment, then he is not happy. Nor must he
merely think himself absorbed, but actually be
so, as are two lovers sitting under one umbrella,
or he who is just making a couplet rhyme."</p>

<p>"Would you say, then," insinuated the Angel,
"that a man is happy when he meets a mad bull
in a narrow lane? For there will surely be much
pressure of life to the square inch."</p>

<p>"It does not follow," responded his dragoman;
"for at such moments one is prone to stand apart,
pitying himself and reflecting on the unevenness
of fortune. But if he collects himself and meets
the occasion with spirit he will enjoy it until,
while sailing over the hedge, he has leisure to reflect
once more. It is clear to me," he proceeded,
"that the fruit of the tree of knowledge in the
old fable was not, as has hitherto been supposed
by a puritanical people, the mere knowledge of
sex, but symbolised rather general self-consciousness;
for I have little doubt that Adam and Eve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
sat together under one umbrella long before they
discovered they had no clothes on. Not until
they became self-conscious about things at large
did they become unhappy."</p>

<p>"Love is commonly reputed by some, and power
by others, to be the keys of happiness," said the
Angel, regardless of his grammar.</p>

<p>"Duds," broke in his dragoman. "For love
and power are only two of the various paths to
absorption, or unconsciousness of self; mere methods
by which men of differing natures succeed in
losing their self-consciousness, for he who, like
Saint Francis, loves all creation, has no time to be
conscious of loving himself, and he who rattles
the sword and rules like Bill Kaser, has no time
to be conscious that he is not ruling himself. I
do not deny that such men may be happy, but
not because of the love or the power. No, it is
because they are loving or ruling with such intensity
that they forget themselves in doing
it."</p>

<p>"There is much in what you say," said the
Angel thoughtfully. "How do you apply it to
the times and land in which you live?"</p>

<p>"Sir," his dragoman responded, "the Englishman
never has been, and is not now, by any
means so unhappy as he looks, for, where you see
a furrow in the brow, or a mouth a little open, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
portends absorption rather than thoughtfulness&mdash;unless,
indeed, it means adenoids&mdash;and is the
mark of a naturally self-forgetful nature; nor
should you suppose that poverty and dirt which
abound, as you see, even under the sway of the
Laborious, is necessarily deterrent to the power
of living in the moment; it may even be a symptom
of that habit. The unhappy are more frequently
the clean and leisured, especially in times
of peace, when they have little to do save sit
under mulberry trees, invest money, pay their
taxes, wash, fly, and think about themselves.
Nevertheless, many of the Laborious also live at
half-cock, and cannot be said to have lost consciousness
of self."</p>

<p>"Then democracy is not synonymous with happiness?"
asked the Angel.</p>

<p>"Dear sir," replied his dragoman, "I know they
said so at the time of the Great Skirmish. But
they said so much that one little one like that
hardly counted. I will let you into a secret. We
have not yet achieved democracy, either here or
anywhere else. The old American saying about
it is all very well, but since not one man in ten
has any real opinion of his own on any subject
on which he votes, he cannot, with the best will
in the world, put it on record. Not until he
learns to have and record his own real opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
will he truly govern himself for himself,
which is, as you know, the test of true democracy."</p>

<p>"I am getting fuddled," said the Angel. "What
is it you want to make you happy?"</p>

<p>His dragoman sat up: "If I am right," he
purred, "in my view that happiness is absorption,
our problem is to direct men's minds to absorption
in right and pleasant things. An American
making a corner in wheat is absorbed and
no doubt happy, yet he is an enemy of mankind,
for his activity is destructive. We should seek
to give our minds to creation, to activities good
for others as well as for ourselves, to simplicity,
pride in work, and forgetfulness of self in every
walk of life. We should do things for the sheer
pleasure of doing them, and not for what they
may or may not be going to bring us in, and be
taught always to give our whole minds to it; in
this way only will the edge of our appetite for
existence remain as keen as a razor which is
stropped every morning by one who knows how.
On the negative side we should be brought up to
be kind, to be clean, to be moderate, and to love
good music, exercise, and fresh air."</p>

<p>"That sounds a bit of all right," said the Angel.
"What measures are being taken in these directions?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
"It has been my habit, sir, to study the Education
Acts of my country ever since that which
was passed at the time of the Great Skirmish;
but, with the exception of exercise, I have not as
yet been able to find any direct allusion to these
matters. Nor is this surprising when you consider
that education is popularly supposed to be,
not for the acquisition of happiness, but for the
good of trade or the promotion of acute self-consciousness
through what we know as culture. If
by any chance there should arise a President of
Education so enlightened as to share my views,
it would be impossible for him to mention the fact
for fear of being sent to Colney Hatch."</p>

<p>"In that case," asked the Angel, "you do not
believe in the progress of your country?"</p>

<p>"Sir," his dragoman replied earnestly, "you
have seen this land for yourself and have heard
from me some account of its growth from the
days when you were last on earth, shortly before
the Great Skirmish; it will not have escaped your
eagle eye that this considerable event has had
some influence in accelerating the course of its
progression; and you will have noticed how, notwithstanding
the most strenuous intentions at
the close of that tragedy, we have yielded to circumstance
and in every direction followed the line
of least resistance."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
"I have a certain sympathy with that," said
the Angel, with a yawn; "it is so much easier."</p>

<p>"So we have found; and our country has got
along, perhaps, as well as one could have expected,
considering what it has had to contend
with: pressure of debt; primrose paths; pelf;
party; patrio-Prussianism; the people; pundits;
Puritans; proctors; property; philosophers; the
Pontifical; and progress. I will not disguise from
you, however, that we are far from perfection;
and it may be that on your next visit, thirty-seven
years hence, we shall be further. For,
however it may be with angels, sir, with men
things do not stand still; and, as I have tried to
make clear to you, in order to advance in body
and spirit, it is necessary to be masters of your
environment and discoveries instead of letting
them be masters of you. Wealthy again we may
be; healthy and happy we are not, as yet."</p>

<p>"I have finished my beer," said the Angel
Æthereal, with finality, "and am ready to rise.
You have nothing to drink! Let me give you a
testimonial instead!" Pulling a quill from his
wing, he dipped it in the mustard and wrote: "A
Dry Dog&mdash;No Good For Trade" on his dragoman's
white hat. "I shall now leave the earth,"
he added.</p>

<p>"I am pleased to hear it," said his dragoman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
"for I fancy that the longer you stay the more
vulgar you will become. I have noticed it growing
on you, sir, just as it does on us."</p>

<p>The Angel smiled. "Meet me by sunlight
alone," he said, "under the left-hand lion in
Trafalgar Square at this hour of this day, in 1984.
Remember me to the waiter, will you? So long!"
And, without pausing for a reply, he spread his
wings, and soared away.</p>

<p>"<i>L'homme moyen sensuel! Sic itur ad astra!</i>"
murmured his dragoman enigmatically, and, lifting
his eyes, he followed the Angel's flight into
the empyrean.</p>
